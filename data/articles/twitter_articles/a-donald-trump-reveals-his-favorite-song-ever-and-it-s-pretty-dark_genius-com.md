In tapes recently released by the New York Times, [Donald Trump](https://genius.com/artists/Donald-trump) said that his favorite song of all time is [Peggy Lee](https://genius.com/artists/Peggy-lee)'s ["Is That All There Is?"](https://genius.com/Peggy-lee-is-that-all-there-is-lyrics) On the tapes, which were recorded interviews by journalist Michael D'Antonio for his 2014 biography The Truth About Trump, the billionaire directly connects the lyrics to the song to his own life:

> It's a great song because I've had these tremendous successes and then I'm off to the next one. Because, it's like, "Oh, is that all there is?" That's a great song actually, that's a very interesting song, especially sung by her, because she had such a troubled life.

The song, a big hit for Lee in 1969, was written by [Jerry Leiber](https://genius.com/artists/Jerry-leiber) and [Mike Stoller](https://genius.com/artists/Mike-stoller), the duo responsible for [Elvis Presley](https://genius.com/artists/Elvis-presley)'s "Hound Dog" and "Jailhouse Rock," among many others.

The lyrics tell a story of successive disillusionments with life, punctuated by a proto-YOLO chorus:

> Is that all there is?\
> Is that all there is?\
> If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing\
> Let's break out the booze and have a ball\
> If that's all there is

Leiber and Stoller got the inspiration for the lyrics from one of the giants of modern European literature, German novelist Thomas Mann. They took liberally from Mann's short story ["Enttäuschung,"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entt%C3%A4uschung_%28Thomas_Mann) which translates to "disappointment" or "disillusionment." The story's narrator describes episodes throughout his life that should've been either terrifying or fulfilling, but always ends up saying to himself, "Is that all there is to it?"

Mann's narrator concludes on a dark note:

> So I dream and wait for death. Ah, how well I know it already, death, that last disappointment! At my last moment I shall be saying to myself: 'So this is the great experience---well, and what of it? What is it after all?'

A rare distinction for a pop song, ["Is That All There Is?"](https://genius.com/Peggy-lee-is-that-all-there-is-lyrics) has come to be emblematic of contemporary feelings of dissatisfaction and meaninglessness. The philosopher Charles Taylor wrote in his 2007 book [A Secular Age](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674026766&content=reviews) that the widespread modern "sense that life is empty, flat, devoid of higher purpose... might borrow as its slogan the title of a song by the American singer Peggy Lee, 'Is that all there is?'"

The lyric does seem to pop into Trump's mind, at times---like in 2015 while he livetweeted President Obama's Oval Office address on ISIL:

Trump doesn't often give the impression of being introspective. Nor does he often ruminate or reflect in public. Clues to the content of his inner-life usually have to be inferred from his insecurities. So perhaps his preference for Peggy Lee's nihilist ballad is the closest we can come to seeing his personal philosophy, which can be summed up in the more Trumpian formula, "What's the big deal?" Is that all there is?
