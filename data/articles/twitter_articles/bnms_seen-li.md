> When friendship for Israel is judged solely on the basis of support for the occupation, Israel has no friends other than racists and nationalists.

> All of a sudden it's not so terrible to be anti-Semitic. Suddenly it's excusable as long as you hate Muslims and Arabs and "love Israel." The Jewish and Israeli right has issued a sweeping amnesty to anti-Semitic lovers of Israel -- yes, there is such a thing, and they're en route to taking power in the United States.\
> So now we know: Not just pornography but also anti-Semitism is a matter of geography and price. Right-wing American anti-Semites are no longer considered anti-Semites.\
> The definition has been updated: From now on, anti-Semites are only found on the left. Roger Waters, a courageous man of conscience without stain, is an anti-Semite. Steve Bannon, a declared racist and closet anti-Semite who has been appointed chief strategist in the Trump White House, is a friend of Israel.\
> Jewish and Israeli activists who left no stone unturned in their effort to discover signs of anti-Semitism, who viewed every parking ticket for an American Jew as an act of hate, who moved heaven and earth every time a Jew was robbed or a Jewish gravestone was cracked, are now whitewashing an anti-Semite. Suddenly they're not convinced we're talking about that particular disease.\
> Alan Dershowitz, one of the biggest propagandists in this field, has already come out in defense of the racist Bannon. In a Haaretz piece late last week, Dershowitz wrote that the man whose wife said he didn't want their children to go to school with Jews isn't anti-Semitic. "The claim was simply made by his former wife in a judicial proceeding, thus giving it no special weight," Dershowitz wrote, with specious logic.\
> After all, Dershowitz's former research assistant, an Orthodox Jew who later worked with Bannon, assured him that he had seen no signs of anti-Semitism in Bannon. And suddenly that's enough for Dershowitz. Suddenly it's possible to separate racism from anti-Semitism.
