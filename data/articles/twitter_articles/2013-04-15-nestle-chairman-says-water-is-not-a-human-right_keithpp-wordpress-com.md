In a candid interview for the documentary [We Feed the World](http://www.we-feed-the-world.at/index.htm "We Feed the World"), Nestlé Chairman Peter Brabeck makes the astonishing claim that water isn't a human right. He attacks the idea that nature is good, and says it is a great achievement that humans are now able to resist nature's dominance. He attacks organic agriculture and says genetic modification is better.

Nestlé is the world's biggest bottler of water. Brabeck claims -- correctly -- that water is the most important raw material in the world. However he then goes on to say that privatisation is the best way to ensure fair distribution. He claims that the idea that water is a human right comes from "extremist" NGOs. Water is a foodstuff like any other, and should have a market value.

He believes that the ultimate social responsibility of any Chairman is to make as much profit as possible, so that people will have jobs.

And just to underline what a lovely man he is, he also thinks we should all be working longer and harder.

**Consequences of water privatisation**

The consequences of water privatisation have been devastating on poor communities around the world. In South Africa, where the municipal workers' union SAMWU fought a long battle against privatisation, there has been substantial research (pdf) about the effects. Water privatisation lead to a [massive cholera outbreak](http://apf.org.za/spip.php?article80) in Durban in the year 2000.

**The Nestlé boycott**

Nestlé already has a very bad reputation among activists. There has been a boycott call since 1977. This is due to Nestlé's aggressive lobbying to get women to stop breastfeeding -- which is free and healthy -- and use infant formula (sold by Nestlé) instead. Nestlé has lobbied governments to tell their health departments to promote formula. In poor countries, this has resulted in the deaths of babies, as women have mixed formula with contaminated water instead of breastfeeding.

**Tell Nestlé they are wrong -- water is a human right**

There is Europe-wide campaign to tell the European Commission that water is a human right, and to ask them to enact legislation to ensure this is protected.
