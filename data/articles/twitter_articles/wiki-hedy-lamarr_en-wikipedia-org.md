Austrian-American actress and co-inventor of an early technique for spread spectrum communications and frequency hopping

**Hedy Lamarr** (), born **Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler**; November 9, 1914[\[a\]](#cite_note-1) -- January 19, 2000) was an [Austrian](/wiki/Austria "Austria")-born American film [actress](/wiki/Actress "Actress"){.mw-redirect} and [inventor](/wiki/Inventor "Inventor").[\[1\]](#cite_note-LaTimes-2)

After a brief early film career in Czechoslovakia, including the controversial *[Ecstasy](/wiki/Ecstasy_(film) "Ecstasy (film)")* (1933), she fled from her husband, a wealthy Austrian ammunition manufacturer, and secretly moved to Paris. Traveling to London,[\[2\]](#cite_note-knowledgenuts_2015-09-07-3) she met [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer](/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer") studio head [Louis B. Mayer](/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer "Louis B. Mayer"), who offered her a movie contract in Hollywood. She became a [film star](/wiki/Movie_star "Movie star") with her performance in *[Algiers](/wiki/Algiers_(film) "Algiers (film)")* (1938).[\[3\]](#cite_note-New_York_Times_obituary-4) Her MGM films include *[Lady of the Tropics](/wiki/Lady_of_the_Tropics "Lady of the Tropics")* (1939), *[Boom Town](/wiki/Boom_Town_(film) "Boom Town (film)")* (1940), *[H.M.

Her greatest success was as Delilah in [Cecil B. DeMille](/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille "Cecil B.

She was honored with a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame "Hollywood Walk of Fame") in 1960.[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

At the beginning of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), she and composer [George Antheil](/wiki/George_Antheil "George Antheil") developed a radio guidance system for [Allied](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") [torpedoes](/wiki/Torpedo "Torpedo") that used [spread spectrum](/wiki/Spread_spectrum "Spread spectrum") and [frequency hopping](/wiki/Frequency_hopping "Frequency hopping"){.mw-redirect} technology to defeat the threat of [jamming](/wiki/Radio_jamming "Radio jamming") by the [Axis powers](/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers").[\[6\]](#cite_note-EFF1997-7) Although the [US Navy](/wiki/US_Navy "US Navy"){.mw-redirect} did not adopt the technology until the 1960s,[\[7\]](#cite_note-8) the principles of their work are incorporated into [Bluetooth](/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth") technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi").[\[8\]](#cite_note-newscientist20112-9)[\[9\]](#cite_note-WiredEFF2-10)[\[10\]](#cite_note-NYT19412-11) This work led to their induction into the [National Inventors Hall of Fame](/wiki/National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame "National Inventors Hall of Fame") in 2014.[\[6\]](#cite_note-EFF1997-7)[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)

Early life

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hedy_Lamarr&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life")

\]

Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in [Vienna](/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), [Austria-Hungary](/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), the only child of Gertrud \"Trude\" Kiesler (née Lichtwitz; 1894--1977) and Emil Kiesler (1880--1935).

Her father was born to a [Galician-Jewish](/wiki/Galician_Jews "Galician Jews") family in [Lemberg](/wiki/Lemberg "Lemberg"){.mw-redirect} (now [Lviv](/wiki/Lviv "Lviv") in [Ukraine](/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")) and was a successful bank director.[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13) Trude, her mother, a pianist and [Budapest](/wiki/Budapest "Budapest") native, had come from an upper-class [Hungarian-Jewish](/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hungary "History of the Jews in Hungary") family. She [converted to Catholicism](/wiki/Conversion_to_Catholicism "Conversion to Catholicism"){.mw-redirect} and raised her daughter Hedy as a Christian as well.[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13):8 Lamarr helped get her mother out of Austria after it had been absorbed by the [Third Reich](/wiki/Third_Reich "Third Reich"){.mw-redirect} and to the United States, where Gertrude later became an American citizen. She put \"[Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_people "Hebrew people"){.mw-redirect}\" as her race on her petition for [naturalization](/wiki/Naturalization "Naturalization"), which was a term often used in Europe.[\[13\]](#cite_note-:0-14)

As a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theatre and film. At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest in Vienna.

Early work

\]

Lamarr was taking acting classes in Vienna when one day, she forged a note from her mother and went to [Sascha-Film](/wiki/Sascha-Film "Sascha-Film") and was able to get herself hired as a [script girl](/wiki/Script_girl "Script girl"){.mw-redirect}. While there, she was able to get a role as an [extra](/wiki/Extra_(acting) "Extra (acting)") in *[Money on the Street](/wiki/Money_on_the_Street "Money on the Street")* (1930), and then a small speaking part in *[Storm in a Water Glass](/wiki/Storm_in_a_Water_Glass "Storm in a Water Glass")* (1931). Producer [Max Reinhardt](/wiki/Max_Reinhardt "Max Reinhardt") then cast her in a play entitled *The Weaker Sex*, which was performed at the [Theater in der Josefstadt](/wiki/Theater_in_der_Josefstadt "Theater in der Josefstadt"). Reinhardt was so impressed with her that he brought her with him back to [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin "Berlin").

However, she never actually trained with Reinhardt or appeared in any of his Berlin productions. Instead, she met the Russian theatre producer [Alexis Granowsky](/wiki/Alexis_Granowsky "Alexis Granowsky"), who cast her in his film directorial debut, *[The Trunks of Mr. O.F.](/wiki/The_Trunks_of_Mr._O.F. "The Trunks of Mr. O.F.")* (1931), starring [Walter Abel](/wiki/Walter_Abel "Walter Abel") and [Peter Lorre](/wiki/Peter_Lorre "Peter Lorre"). Granowsky soon moved to Paris, but Lamarr stayed in Berlin and was given the lead role in *[No Money Needed](/wiki/No_Money_Needed "No Money Needed")* (1932), a comedy directed by [Carl Boese](/wiki/Carl_Boese "Carl Boese"). Lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous.

In early 1933, at age 18, Lamarr, then working under the name Hedy Kiesler, was given the lead in [Gustav Machatý](/wiki/Gustav_Machat%C3%BD "Gustav Machatý")\'s film *[Ecstasy](/wiki/Ecstasy_(film) "Ecstasy (film)")* (*Ekstase* in German, *Extase* in Czech). She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.

The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr\'s face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes, a result of her being \"duped\" by the director and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19)[\[b\]](#cite_note-20)[\[19\]](#cite_note-21)

Although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award in [Rome](/wiki/Rome "Rome"). Throughout Europe, it was regarded an artistic work. In America it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity, especially among women\'s groups.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19) It was banned there and in Germany.[\[20\]](#cite_note-doc-22)

### 

Marriage

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hedy_Lamarr&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Marriage")

\]

Lamarr had played a number of stage roles, including a starring one in *Sissy*, a play about [Empress Elisabeth of Austria](/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria "Empress Elisabeth of Austria") produced in Vienna (in early 1933, just as *Extasy* premiered). It won accolades from critics.[\[21\]](#cite_note-23)[\[22\]](#cite_note-24) Admirers sent roses to her [dressing room](/wiki/Dressing_room "Dressing room"){.mw-redirect} and tried to get backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, [Friedrich Mandl](/wiki/Friedrich_Mandl "Friedrich Mandl").[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19) He became obsessed with getting to know her.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Lemelson-25)

Mandl was an Austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third-richest man in Austria. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial wealth.[\[20\]](#cite_note-doc-22) Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl\'s ties to Italian fascist leader [Benito Mussolini](/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini"), and later, German Führer [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), but they could not stop the headstrong Lamarr.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19)

On August 10, 1933, Lamarr married Mandl. She was 18 years old and he was 33. In her autobiography *[Ecstasy and Me](/wiki/Ecstasy_and_Me "Ecstasy and Me")*, she described Mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in *Ecstasy* and prevented her from pursuing her acting career. She claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home,[\[20\]](#cite_note-doc-22) [Castle Schwarzenau](/w/index.php?title=Castle_Schwarzenau&action=edit&redlink=1 "Castle Schwarzenau (page does not exist)"){.new} \[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Schwarzenau_(Waldviertel) "de:Schloss Schwarzenau (Waldviertel)"){.extiw}\] in the remote Waldviertel near the Czech border.

Hedy Lamarr, 1944

Mandl had close social and business ties to the Italian government, selling munitions to the country,[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13) and had ties to the [Nazi](/wiki/Nazi "Nazi"){.mw-redirect} regime of Germany. This despite his own father being Jewish, just like Lamarr\'s. Lamarr wrote that both Mussolini and Hitler attended lavish parties at the Mandl home.\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\] Lamarr accompanied Mandl to business meetings, where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences were her introduction to the field of [applied science](/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science") and nurtured her latent talent in science.[\[24\]](#cite_note-26)

Lamarr\'s marriage to Mandl eventually became unbearable, and she decided to flee her husband as well as her country. In her [autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography "Autobiography"), she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to Paris, but by other accounts, she persuaded Mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party, then disappeared afterward.[\[25\]](#cite_note-friedrich1997-27) She writes about her marriage:

> I knew very soon that I could never be an actress while I was his wife. \... He was the absolute monarch in his marriage. \... I was like a doll. I was like a thing, some object of art which had to be guarded---and imprisoned---having no mind, no life of its own.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Rhodes-28)

Louis B. Mayer and MGM

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hedy_Lamarr&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Louis B. Mayer and MGM")

\]

After arriving in London[\[2\]](#cite_note-knowledgenuts_2015-09-07-3) in 1937, she met [Louis B. Mayer](/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer "Louis B. Mayer"), head of [MGM](/wiki/MGM "MGM"){.mw-redirect}, who was scouting for talent in Europe.[\[27\]](#cite_note-29) She initially turned down the offer he made her (of \$125 a week), but then booked herself onto the same New York bound liner as him, and managed to impress him enough to secure a \$500 a week contract. Mayer persuaded her to change her name from Hedwig Kiesler (to distance herself from \"the *Ecstasy* lady\" reputation associated with it)[\[25\]](#cite_note-friedrich1997-27), choosing the surname \"Lamarr\" in homage to the beautiful silent film star, [Barbara La Marr](/wiki/Barbara_La_Marr "Barbara La Marr"), on the suggestion of his wife Margaret Shenberg, who admired La Marr.

Mayer brought Lamarr to Hollywood in 1938 and began promoting her as the \"world\'s most beautiful woman\".[\[28\]](#cite_note-30) He then introduced her to producer [Walter Wanger](/wiki/Walter_Wanger "Walter Wanger"), who was making *[Algiers](/wiki/Algiers_(film) "Algiers (film)")* (1938), an American version of the French film, *[Pépé le Moko](/wiki/P%C3%A9p%C3%A9_le_Moko "Pépé le Moko")* (1937). Lamarr was cast in the lead opposite [Charles Boyer](/wiki/Charles_Boyer "Charles Boyer"). The film created a \"national sensation\", says Shearer.[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13):77 She was billed as an unknown but well-publicized Austrian actress, which created anticipation in audiences. Mayer hoped she would become another [Greta Garbo](/wiki/Greta_Garbo "Greta Garbo") or [Marlene Dietrich](/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich "Marlene Dietrich").[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13):77 According to one viewer, when her face first appeared on the screen, \"everyone gasped \... Lamarr\'s beauty literally took one\'s breath away.\"[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13):2

In future Hollywood films, she was invariably [typecast](/wiki/Typecasting_(acting) "Typecasting (acting)") as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin. Her second American film was to be *[I Take This Woman](/wiki/I_Take_This_Woman_(1940_film) "I Take This Woman (1940 film)")*, co-starring with [Spencer Tracy](/wiki/Spencer_Tracy "Spencer Tracy") under the direction of regular Dietrich collaborator, [Josef von Sternberg](/wiki/Josef_von_Sternberg "Josef von Sternberg"). Von Sternberg was fired during the shoot, replaced by [Frank Borzage](/wiki/Frank_Borzage "Frank Borzage"). The film was put on hold, and Lamarr was put into *[Lady of the Tropics](/wiki/Lady_of_the_Tropics "Lady of the Tropics")* (1939), where she played a mixed-race seductress in Saigon opposite [Robert Taylor](/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor) "Robert Taylor (actor)"). She returned to *I Take This Woman*, re-shot by [W. S. Van Dyke](/wiki/W._S._Van_Dyke "W. S. Van Dyke"). The resulting film was a flop.

Far more popular was *[Boom Town](/wiki/Boom_Town_(film) "Boom Town (film)")* (1940) with [Clark Gable](/wiki/Clark_Gable "Clark Gable"), [Claudette Colbert](/wiki/Claudette_Colbert "Claudette Colbert") and [Spencer Tracy](/wiki/Spencer_Tracy "Spencer Tracy"); it made \$5 million.[\[29\]](#cite_note-Mannix-31) MGM promptly reteamed Lamarr and Gable in *[Comrade X](/wiki/Comrade_X "Comrade X")* (1940), a comedy film in the vein of *[Ninotchka](/wiki/Ninotchka "Ninotchka")* (1939), which was another hit.

Lamarr was teamed with [James Stewart](/wiki/James_Stewart "James Stewart") in *[Come Live with Me](/wiki/Come_Live_with_Me_(film) "Come Live with Me (film)")* (1941), playing a Viennese refugee. Stewart was also in *[Ziegfeld Girl](/wiki/Ziegfeld_Girl_(film) "Ziegfeld Girl (film)")* (1941), where Lamarr, [Judy Garland](/wiki/Judy_Garland "Judy Garland") and [Lana Turner](/wiki/Lana_Turner "Lana Turner") played aspiring showgirls - a big success.[\[29\]](#cite_note-Mannix-31)

Lamarr was top-billed in *[H. M. Pulham, Esq.](/wiki/H._M._Pulham,_Esq. "H. M. Pulham, Esq.")* (1941), although the film\'s protagonist was the title role played by [Robert Young](/wiki/Robert_Young_(actor) "Robert Young (actor)"). She made a third film with Tracy, *[Tortilla Flat](/wiki/Tortilla_Flat_(film) "Tortilla Flat (film)")* (1942). It was successful at the box office, as was *[Crossroads](/wiki/Crossroads_(1942_film) "Crossroads (1942 film)")* (1942) with [William Powell](/wiki/William_Powell "William Powell").

Lamarr played the seductive native girl Tondelayo in *[White Cargo](/wiki/White_Cargo "White Cargo")* (1942), top billed over [Walter Pidgeon](/wiki/Walter_Pidgeon "Walter Pidgeon"). It was a huge hit. *White Cargo* contains arguably her most memorable film quote, delivered with provocative invitation: \"I am Tondelayo. I make [tiffin](/wiki/Tiffin "Tiffin") for you?\" This line typifies many of Lamarr\'s roles, which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines. The lack of acting challenges bored Lamarr. She reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.[\[30\]](#cite_note-npr.org-32)

She was reunited with Powell in a comedy *[The Heavenly Body](/wiki/The_Heavenly_Body "The Heavenly Body")* (1944), then was borrowed by Warner Bros for *[The Conspirators](/wiki/The_Conspirators_(1944_film) "The Conspirators (1944 film)")* (1944). This was an attempt to repeat the success of *Casablanca* (1943), and RKO borrowed her for a melodrama *[Experiment Perilous](/wiki/Experiment_Perilous "Experiment Perilous")* (1944).

Lamarr in(1945)

Back at MGM Lamarr was teamed with [Robert Walker](/wiki/Robert_Walker_(actor,_born_1918) "Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)") in the romantic comedy *[Her Highness and the Bellboy](/wiki/Her_Highness_and_the_Bellboy "Her Highness and the Bellboy")* (1945), playing a princess who falls in love with a New Yorker. It was very popular, but would be the last film she made under her MGM contract.[\[31\]](#cite_note-33)

Her off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image. She spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent\'s pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression:

> Hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them, and she forces herself to be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19)

Author [Richard Rhodes](/wiki/Richard_Rhodes "Richard Rhodes") describes her [assimilation](/wiki/Cultural_assimilation "Cultural assimilation") into American culture:

> Of all the European émigrés who escaped Nazi Germany and Nazi Austria, she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full-fledged star herself. There were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally. She really was a resourceful human being--I think because of her father\'s strong influence on her as a child.[\[32\]](#cite_note-Sarandon-34)

Wartime fundraiser

Lamarr wanted to join the [National Inventors Council](/wiki/National_Inventors_Council "National Inventors Council"), but was reportedly told by NIC member [Charles F. Kettering](/wiki/Charles_F._Kettering "Charles F. Kettering") and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell [war bonds](/wiki/War_bond#United_States_2 "War bond").[\[33\]](#cite_note-35)[\[34\]](#cite_note-36)

She participated in a war bond-selling campaign with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would kiss Rhodes and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.[\[35\]](#cite_note-37)

### 

Producer

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hedy_Lamarr&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Producer")

\]

After leaving MGM in 1945, Lamarr formed a production company with [Jack Chertok](/wiki/Jack_Chertok "Jack Chertok") and made the thriller *[The Strange Woman](/wiki/The_Strange_Woman "The Strange Woman")* (1946). It went over budget and only made minor profits.[\[36\]](#cite_note-tino-38)

She and Chertok then made *[Dishonored Lady](/wiki/Dishonored_Lady "Dishonored Lady")* (1947), another thriller starring Lamarr, which also went over budget - but was not a commercial success. She tried a comedy with [Robert Cummings](/wiki/Robert_Cummings "Robert Cummings"), *[Let\'s Live a Little](/wiki/Let%27s_Live_a_Little "Let's Live a Little")* (1948).

Lamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing [Delilah](/wiki/Delilah "Delilah") against [Victor Mature](/wiki/Victor_Mature "Victor Mature") as the [Biblical strongman](/wiki/Samson "Samson") in [Cecil B. DeMille](/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille "Cecil B. DeMille")\'s *[Samson and Delilah](/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_(1949_film) "Samson and Delilah (1949 film)")*, the highest-grossing film of 1949. The film also won two Oscars.[\[20\]](#cite_note-doc-22)

Lamarr returned to MGM for a [film noir](/wiki/Film_noir "Film noir") with [John Hodiak](/wiki/John_Hodiak "John Hodiak"), *[A Lady Without Passport](/wiki/A_Lady_Without_Passport "A Lady Without Passport")* (1950), which flopped. More popular were two pictures she made at Paramount, a Western with [Ray Milland](/wiki/Ray_Milland "Ray Milland"), *[Copper Canyon](/wiki/Copper_Canyon_(film) "Copper Canyon (film)")* (1950), and a [Bob Hope](/wiki/Bob_Hope "Bob Hope") spy spoof, *[My Favorite Spy](/wiki/My_Favorite_Spy "My Favorite Spy")* (1951).

Her career went into decline. She went to Italy to play multiple roles in *[Loves of Three Queens](/wiki/Loves_of_Three_Queens "Loves of Three Queens")* (1954), which she also produced. However she lacked the experience necessary to make a success of such an epic production, and lost millions of dollars when she was unable to secure distribution of the picture.

She was [Joan of Arc](/wiki/Joan_of_Arc "Joan of Arc") in [Irwin Allen](/wiki/Irwin_Allen "Irwin Allen")\'s critically panned epic, *[The Story of Mankind](/wiki/The_Story_of_Mankind_(film) "The Story of Mankind (film)")* (1957) and did episodes of *[Zane Grey Theatre](/wiki/Zane_Grey_Theatre "Zane Grey Theatre"){.mw-redirect}* (\"Proud Woman\") and *[Shower of Stars](/wiki/Shower_of_Stars "Shower of Stars")* (\"Cloak and Dagger\"). Her last film was a thriller *[The Female Animal](/wiki/The_Female_Animal "The Female Animal")* (1958).

Lamarr was signed to act in the 1966 film *[Picture Mommy Dead](/wiki/Picture_Mommy_Dead "Picture Mommy Dead")*,[\[37\]](#cite_note-39) but was let go when she collapsed during filming from nervous exhaustion.[\[38\]](#cite_note-los-40) She was replaced in the role of Jessica Flagmore Shelley by [Zsa Zsa Gabor](/wiki/Zsa_Zsa_Gabor "Zsa Zsa Gabor").

Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved [traffic stoplight](/wiki/Traffic_light "Traffic light") and a [tablet](/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy) "Tablet (pharmacy)") that would dissolve in water to create a [carbonated drink](/wiki/Soft_drink "Soft drink"). The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like [Alka-Seltzer](/wiki/Alka-Seltzer "Alka-Seltzer").[\[30\]](#cite_note-npr.org-32)

Copy of U.S. patent for \"Secret Communication System\"

Among the few who knew of Lamarr\'s inventiveness was aviation tycoon [Howard Hughes](/wiki/Howard_Hughes "Howard Hughes"). She suggested he change the rather square design of his aeroplanes (which she thought looked too slow) to a more streamlined shape, based on pictures of the fastest birds and fish she could find. Lamarr discussed her relationship with Hughes during an interview, saying that while they dated, he actively supported her inventive \"tinkering\" hobbies. He put his team of scientists and engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or make anything she asked for.[\[39\]](#cite_note-Vanity-41)

During [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Lamarr learned that radio-controlled [torpedoes](/wiki/Torpedo "Torpedo"), an emerging technology in naval war, could easily be [jammed](/wiki/Radio_jamming "Radio jamming") and set off course.[\[40\]](#cite_note-ScienceShow-42) She thought of creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist [George Antheil](/wiki/George_Antheil "George Antheil"), to help her develop a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized [player-piano](/wiki/Player-piano "Player-piano"){.mw-redirect} mechanism with radio signals.[\[32\]](#cite_note-Sarandon-34) They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system, which they patented.[\[41\]](#cite_note-Rhodes2-43)[\[42\]](#cite_note-cnsNews-wifi-44) Antheil recalled:

> We began talking about the war, which, in the late summer of 1940, was looking most extremely black. Hedy said that she did not feel very comfortable, sitting there in Hollywood and making lots of money when things were in such a state. She said that she knew a good deal about munitions and various secret weapons \... and that she was thinking seriously of quitting MGM and going to Washington, DC, to offer her services to the newly established Inventors\' Council.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Lemelson-25)

Their invention was granted a patent under [US Patent 2,292,387](http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT2292387){.external .text} on August 11, 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey).[\[43\]](#cite_note-45) However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at that time the U.S. Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military.[\[30\]](#cite_note-npr.org-32) In 1962 (at the time of the [Cuban missile crisis](/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis "Cuban missile crisis"){.mw-redirect}), an updated version of their design at last appeared on Navy ships.[\[44\]](#cite_note-46)

In 1997, Lamarr and Antheil received the [Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award](/wiki/EFF_Pioneer_Award "EFF Pioneer Award") and the Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society.[\[45\]](#cite_note-47) Lamarr was featured on the [Science Channel](/wiki/Science_Channel "Science Channel") and the [Discovery Channel](/wiki/Discovery_Channel "Discovery Channel").[\[13\]](#cite_note-:0-14) In 2014, Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the [National Inventors Hall of Fame](/wiki/National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame "National Inventors Hall of Fame").[\[46\]](#cite_note-48)

Later years

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hedy_Lamarr&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Later years")

\]

Lamarr became a [naturalized citizen](/wiki/Naturalized_citizen "Naturalized citizen"){.mw-redirect} of the United States at age 38 on April 10, 1953. Her [autobiography](/wiki/Autobiography "Autobiography"), *[Ecstasy and Me](/wiki/Ecstasy_and_Me "Ecstasy and Me")*, was published in 1966, although she said on TV that it was not written by her, and much of it was fictional.[\[47\]](#cite_note-Griffin-49) Lamarr later sued the publisher, saying that many details were fabricated by its [ghost writer](/wiki/Ghost_writer "Ghost writer"){.mw-redirect}, Leo Guild.[\[48\]](#cite_note-50)[\[49\]](#cite_note-51) Lamarr, in turn, was sued by Gene Ringgold, who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in 1965 for *Screen Facts* magazine.[\[50\]](#cite_note-52)

In the late 1950s Lamarr designed and, with then-husband W. Howard Lee, developed the Villa LaMarr ski resort in Aspen, Colorado.[\[51\]](#cite_note-53)[\[52\]](#cite_note-54)

In 1966, Lamarr was arrested in Los Angeles for [shoplifting](/wiki/Shoplifting "Shoplifting"). The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in Florida, this time for stealing \$21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops.[\[53\]](#cite_note-55) She pleaded no contest to avoid a court appearance, and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year.[\[54\]](#cite_note-56) The shoplifting charges coincided with a failed attempt to return to the screen.

The 1970s were a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr. She was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed a \$10 million lawsuit against [Warner Bros.](/wiki/Warner_Bros. "Warner Bros."), claiming that the running parody of her name (\"Hedley Lamarr\") in the [Mel Brooks](/wiki/Mel_Brooks "Mel Brooks") comedy *[Blazing Saddles](/wiki/Blazing_Saddles "Blazing Saddles")* infringed her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to Lamarr for \"almost using her name\". Brooks said that Lamarr \"never got the joke\".[\[55\]](#cite_note-DVD-57) With her eyesight failing, Lamarr retreated from public life and settled in [Miami Beach, Florida](/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida "Miami Beach, Florida"), in 1981.[\[12\]](#cite_note-shearer-13)

A large [Corel](/wiki/Corel "Corel")-drawn image of Lamarr won [CorelDRAW](/wiki/CorelDRAW "CorelDRAW")\'s yearly software suite cover design contest in 1996. For several years, beginning in 1997, it was featured on boxes of the software suite. Lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission. Corel countered that she did not own rights to the image. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.[\[57\]](#cite_note-59)[\[58\]](#cite_note-60)

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Lamarr has a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame](/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame "Hollywood Walk of Fame") at 6247 Hollywood Blvd[\[59\]](#cite_note-61)[\[60\]](#cite_note-62) adjacent to [Vine Street](/wiki/Hollywood_and_Vine "Hollywood and Vine") where the walk is centered.

Lamarr became estranged from her adopted son, James Lamarr Loder, when he was 12 years old. Their relationship ended abruptly, and he moved in with another family. They did not speak again for almost 50 years. Lamarr left James Loder out of her will, and he sued for control of the US\$3.3 million estate left by Lamarr in 2000.[\[61\]](#cite_note-63) He eventually settled for US\$50,000.[\[62\]](#cite_note-64)

In the last decades of her life, the telephone became Lamarr\'s only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone, but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years. A documentary, *Calling Hedy Lamarr*, was released in 2004 and featured her children, Anthony Loder and Denise Loder-DeLuca.

1.  [**[\^](#cite_ref-1)**]{#cite_note-1}

    According to Lamarr biographer [Stephen Michael Shearer](#Shearer) (pp. 8, 339), she was born in 1914, not 1913.

2.  [**[\^](#cite_ref-20)**[\[18\]](#cite_note-Liberty-19)]{#cite_note-20}

    When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming. Anxious for the job, she signed the contract without reading it. When, during an outdoor scene, the director told her to disrobe, she protested and threatened to quit, but he said that if she refused, she would have to pay for the cost of all the scenes already filmed. To calm her, he said they were using \"long shots\" in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her. She left the theater in tears, worried about her parents\' reaction and that it might have ruined her budding career.
