The following is a **list of ethnic slurs** (**ethnophaulisms**) that are, or have been, used as [insinuations](/wiki/Insinuation "Insinuation"){.mw-redirect} or [allegations](/wiki/Allegation "Allegation") about members of a given [ethnicity](/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group"), or to refer to them in a derogatory (that is, critical or disrespectful), [pejorative](/wiki/Pejorative "Pejorative") (disapproving or contemptuous), or otherwise [insulting](/wiki/Insult "Insult") manner.

Some of the terms listed below (such as \"Gringo\", \"Yank\", etc.) are used by many people all over the world as part of their ordinary speech or thinking without any intention of causing offence.

For the purposes of this list, an *ethnic slur* is a term designed to insult others on the basis of [race](/wiki/Racism "Racism"), [ethnicity](/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity"){.mw-redirect}, or [nationality](/wiki/Nationality "Nationality"). Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and a reference to that term.

Ethnic slurs may also be produced as a racial [epithet](/wiki/Epithet "Epithet") by combining a general-purpose insult with the name of ethnicity, such as \"dirty Jew\", \"Russian pig\", etc. Other common insulting modifiers include \"dog\", \"filthy\", etc. Such terms are not included in this list.
