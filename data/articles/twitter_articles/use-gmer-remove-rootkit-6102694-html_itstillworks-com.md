How to Use GMER to Remove a Rootkit
===================================

by Craig McPherson

Rootkits are a particularly nasty type of spyware that compromises the security of any user of your system or network. Rootkits came to prominence in the mid 2000s when Sony BMG, in an attempt to curb music piracy, included a Rootkit in some of their CDs. As a result of this, a user who played the infected CD on their computer risked infection. Anyone with the knowledge of the Sony Rootkit installation was able to gain access to an infected system. Since then, Rootkits have evolved into an extremely dangerous and ever-mutating form of spyware. Fortunately, GMER\'s Rootkit Detector and Remover streamlines the process of removing the offending software.
