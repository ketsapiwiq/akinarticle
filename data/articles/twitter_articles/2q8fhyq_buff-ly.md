Bjenny Montero is a Melbourne-based artist you\'ll be hearing more about soon. He\'s designed [merch for Mac DeMarco](https://www.omnianmusicgroup.com/products/mac-demarco-by-benny-montero-cotton-t-shirt) and [an album cover for Pond](http://designspiration.net/image/13233433851816/). His style is reminiscent of Fred Wolf\'s 1971 animated movie *The Point* (scored by Harry Nilsson, which also feels relevant) combined with a Sesame Street storyboard. The humanimal creatures in the comics he posts regularly on social media are often depressed, in search of love, and/or basking in the glow of someone special. Each one I\'ve seen resonates. I find myself involuntarily moving my hand to my heart, or blinking as my eyes suddenly become hot. And then, wanting to be a better person, and cherish what I have.
