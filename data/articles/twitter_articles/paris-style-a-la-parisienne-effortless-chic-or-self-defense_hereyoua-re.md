Style à la Parisienne: Effortless-Chic or Self-Defense?
=======================================================

Around the world, Parisian women are looked to for their iconic style. Every generation has had it's femme du jour from whom it could draw sartorial inspiration, from Coco Chanel to Charlotte Gainsbourg, and of course Gainsbourg's mother, Jane Birkin. (Hermès doesn't name its handbags after anyone, you know.) Parisian-style seems to be one paradox after the next. It's causal yet elegant. It's sexy, but not never vulgar. It's effortless and somehow very put together.

It's also a myth.

Having been brought up in Paris part-time myself, I can tell you that, one, not every Parisian woman (or man) dresses well, and two, "effortless" mon cul (re: my ass). What time Parisian women save contouring their faces to look like a Kardashian, they invest in finding the perfect perfume. Their priorities and standards of beauty are simply different, but try they do. If a French woman doesn't wash her hair, it's not because she doesn't care, it's because she's trained her locks to follow a strict 3-4 day wash regimen to give her that perfect, post-coital coiffe, sans actual coitus.

> The most perplexing aspect of contemporary Parisian fashion is how it accepts and often rejects, female sexuality

But perhaps the most perplexing aspect of contemporary Parisian fashion is how it accepts and often rejects, female sexuality and the female form. The French hold a strong monopoly on Western ideas of romance and sexiness, and yet Parisian women are much more conservatively dressed then their romantic reputations would suggest. Save for their lingerie, should you have the pleasure of seeing it anywhere other than the rack, French women dress comparatively unsexy by most American standards.

Growing up amongst my Parisian relatives, I was taught that heels mustn't be to high-- same goes for my hem. Deep cleavage? Mais non! While we're at, let's forget about breasts all together. (Great news for my genetics, but not for women in general). But all these rules beg the question: Pourquoi ? The world has accepted Parisian women's style and co-opting of menswear as irreverently chic, but I'd argue that what might appear as a sartorial middle finger to the patriarchy is in fact a protective mechanism against it.

While Paris might not be dangerous in the way our Second Amendment-loving cities are, they way women are viewed and sometimes treated is in many ways much less progressive and often criminal. In the U.S., rape is notoriously under-reported, with only about [one third of victims](https://www.visualnews.com/2015/07/28/the-rape-statistics-you-need-to-know/) coming forward. But a recent study suggests that the situation is far worse in the so-called City of Love, where it is believed as many as [9 out of 10 rapes go unreported](https://news.vice.com/article/new-study-looks-at-rapes-in-paris-and-says-nine-out-of-ten-go-unreported).This might come as a shock to those that have only visited Paris as a tourist, but having grown up there, I was always taught to be aware of my surroundings and eliminate the chance provocation, which of course meant dressing a certain way. This advice is of particular import when riding the Métro. Somehow, incidents of sexual assault are much more common below ground than above it. Don't believe me? According to [one survey](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11545643/100-per-cent-of-Frenchwomen-victims-of-sexual-harassment-on-public-transport.html), 100% of of the 600 Parisian women polled cited incidents of sexual harassment on public transport.

It's not only on the way to work that women suffer, even in the most esteemed offices, French women are being harassed with little judicial recourse. Back in May, France's finance minister, Michel Sapin faced [allegations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/french-minister-michel-sapin-sorry-inappropriate-gesture-journalist) of having snapped the elastic of a female journalist's underwear. Despite outcry from female politicians and journalists alike, Sapin still holds his position. Perhaps it is no wonder that high waisted trousers and oversize sweaters remain permanently en vogue for French female professionals.

> Suddenly, their "chic" and "effortless" style feels a lot less like a choice and more like a method of self-defense

It goes without saying that every woman should and ought to be able to dress however she pleases, no matter where she lives. What a woman wear (or doesn't wear) should never be interpreted as an invitation or solicitation. But it's these kinds of statistics that shed an entirely different light on French-girl fashion. Suddenly, their "chic" and "effortless" style feels a lot less like a choice and more like a method of self-defense. And it's not just women's wardrobes that are affected. The French prescription for bodily beauty follows an eerily similar pattern of defeminization. Thinness isn't just a cultural value, it also makes you less of a target (There are also issues of race at play here, but that deserves its own analysis entirely.)

It's perhaps a lucky twist of fate that French-girl fashion has liberated non-French women from their own unattainable and uncomfortable cultural beauty standards. Make up isn't really my thing. I love a good men's button down shirt, and I'll never be the kind of woman that wears stilettos to the office or anywhere I'm not taking a cab to, for that matter. If I have my French upbringing to thank for all that, so be it. Merci beau-fucking-coup. But as a woman who has been sexually assaulted in public, and was later asked by the police, "What were you wearing?" I believe it is imperative that we don't take things that seems as frivolous as fashion for granted.
