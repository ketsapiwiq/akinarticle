-   Why didn\'t Rick use Human DNA in Rick Potion Number 9? And why did he rescue Morty, but not his daughter or granddaughter? Same reason: To make Morty more dependent on him. As far as Morty knows, Rick is the only family he has left.
-   At the end of \'Anatomy Park\', Rick enlarges the hobo\'s dead body to help Morty and at the end, destroys the corpse with the dynamite he stuffed into the hobo\'s corpse. The hobo\'s blood rains upon the whole United States. Blood that came from a hobo that had many dangerous diseases kept inside him. And it gets worse. Given that the cadaver was giant when it was blown up, you can take your panic: giant monster-sized virus, or said virus, normal sized, getting spread out everywhere. Either way, we\'re still going with the first pick. **[SWEET DREAMS](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel"){.twikilink}**
    -   But it gains some [Nightmare Retardant](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant"){.twikilink} when you find out that since the body exploded, all the viruses in there were clearly and obviously killed in the explosion.
        -   Plus it exploded [IN SPACE!](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace"){.twikilink}.
        -   Given that Morty was full size, the diseases would be giant, and thus vulnerable to fall damage. They all would\'ve died on impact when they hit the ground. Assuming they didn\'t burn up in the atmosphere or die in the vacuum of space.
-   At the end of \"Rick Potion \#9\" Rick seems completely uninterested at the fact that he jumped timelines while Morty is freaked out. Has Rick done this before? That would mean the last time he did it, he didn\'t even bring Morty from his original timeline, but simply changed places with the Rick Morty grew up with and Morty never realized it.
    -   Better yet, finding a timeline where one of his counterparts was able to solve the problem is plausible; just look for the most similar one where everyone\'s not dead. The headscratcher is; How did his [\"scouting\"![](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif){width="12" height="12"}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jil8i5iS6eo){.urllink} locate one where both he and Morty died exactly **five seconds** **before** they entered it? The only way to interpret that is that Rick has some way of telling when people are about to die. And only uses it to run from his biggest screw-ups.
    -   Or simply, due to infinite universes existing, Rick deduced a universe specifically where alternate Rick and Morty have to die for the replacement.
-   Cronenberg-Rick

    and

    Cronenberg-Morty

    aren\'t going to fit in at all on \"our\" earth! They think and act like humans, while \"our\"

    Cronenbergs

    are basically an unstable slurry of random genes and animal instincts.

    Cronenberg-Rick\'s

    put himself and his grandson in incredible danger! How would he be so irresponsib---[Oh, wait. Yup, that\'s Rick, alright.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance"){.twikilink}

    -   Cronenberg-Rick and Cronenberg-Morty

        came from a universe where everyone was turned back to normal except for them. If Rick and Morty had waited a little while longer, they wouldn\'t have had to travel to a universe where

        they were both killed.

        Poor Morty\...

        -   It wouldn\'t matter because

            Cronenberg-Rick and Cronenberg-Morty

            came from a universe where

            everyone was originally a cronenberg

            . Rick and Morty would not have been able to

            take their place there and return to their \"normal\" lives

            because

            they lack the memories of being a cronenberg from birth

            . Plus, if that universe is anything like theirs than

            Morty\'s family are still cronenbergs

            .

    -   And unlike our Rick

        Cronenberg-Rick

        brought them to a universe where

        they presumably wouldn\'t be able to resume their previous lives

        . That might imply that

        Cronenberg-Rick ran out of universes to do that with, making Rick\'s statement that him and Morty only get 3 or 4 these all the more true

        .

-   Another one at the end of \"Rick Potion \#9\", you remember Leonard and Joyce? Jerry\'s parents? And their

    sexual

    partner Jacob? And how Rick said that the

    love potion doesn\'t affect anyone with their family\'s strain of DNA, then you don\'t need to be a genius to realize what could- nay, probably happened between the three of them.

-   In \'Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind\' Evil!Rick and our Rick are only divided by another Rick and there are Ricks far worse than him, judging by the scale which puts them in the middle.
    -   Maybe this is a reference to

        the shadow council that Evil Morty killed as his last act before taking full power.

-   Maybe the reason Evil! Morty killed his Rick was that he was the Rick-est Morty on the Rick & Morty spectrum.

-   It was said by the Council that 27 Ricks were murdered

    but Evil Rick has hundreds of Mortys

    how many Ricks were murdered without the Council knowing?

-   At the end of \"Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind\", Rick tries to comfort Morty saying that, since he\'s the Rick-est Rick, he must be the Morty-est Morty. But the \"Rick-est Rick\" is a positive statement only to him, he\'s actually extremely manipulative, self-centred and genocidal, and Morty is shown to have a lot of undealth-with rage. So what does exactly Rick considers to be \"Morty-est\"?
-   Jerry\'s description of what he thinks a rapist looks like is pretty specific. Was

    the Titanic recreation with Lucy not the first time he was in a rape scenario?

    **Jerry (\"Pilot\"):** Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas. \[\...\]It\'s personal.

-   Mr. Meeseeks is pretty much an Implacable Man. Nothing can kill it, except for fulfilling its task. They are able to survive being brutally mutilated, having massive chunks of its body, even entire limbs, torn off. And they will do absolutely ANYTHING to complete their goals, consequences be damned, and they have zero qualms with killing innocent bystanders. So\...hopefully nobody ever gets the idea to use a Meeseeks to commit murder. It would be like the equivalent of a Terminator. Nothing would be able to stop it. Weapons won\'t work because it\'ll just shrug them right off to get to its target. And what if it starts taking too long, and the Meeseeks calls in more Meeseeks to help him out? Many police and loved ones, innocent bystanders, would die in the crossfire. There would be blood spilled all over, and Mr. Meeseeks is guaranteed to come out on top in the end because we CAN\'T. KILL THEM. The only hope you\'ll EVER have of being safe from a Meeseeks is POSSIBLY destroying its entire body\...But even then, it\'s likely you\'ll have an army of other Meeseeks to destroy\...
    -   What happens if you steal the Meeseeks-Box, and task a Meeseeks to prevent being assassinated by a Meeseeks?
        -   Assuming all Meeseeks are equally competent at carrying out their tasks, they go crazy after about a week of foiling each other\'s plans and decide to cut the problem off at the source (where the problem is you and the \"source\" probably represents your head). Unless one of them manages to succeed just by being luckier.
    -   Hilariously the game [Pocket Mortys](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketMortys "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PocketMortys"){.twikilink} confirms this fear, as the Meeseeks Box is used to instantly defeat one opponent, regardless of their stats or hit points.
    -   And one of the recent shorts promoting season three shows that when a Meeseeks\' body is destroyed, it\'ll just poof back into existence perfectly intact. There is truly no way to kill these things aside from completing their assigned tasks\...
-   All it takes is one snarky comment from Morty about

    Rick\'s alcoholism

    to knock away Rick\'s certainty in himself. What makes this [especially horrifying](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven"){.twikilink}? That small amount of uncertainty

    is all Rick needs to make him essentially suicidal.

-   Evil Rick says in \"Close Rick-Counters\" that his plan is to download the contents of other Ricks\' brains, then kill them.

    But Evil Morty was the one really controlling him. This means that Evil Morty has the knowledge of possibly hundreds of Ricks spanning multiple dimensions

    .

    -   It\'s a little eerie that Rick

        did a variation of that

        in The Rickshank Redemption. He

        uploaded himself into the brains of other Ricks & then killed them.

        He\'s even

        been in one of their bodies ever since

        & he\'s been a lot more callous lately. Their evil behavior could be influencing him.

-   In \"Close Rick-Counters,\" we see glimpses of prime Rick\'s memories when Evil Rick holds him captive. One of these memories is Rick holding Morty when he was only an infant. While it\'s really heartwarming to see him cry from such a memory, Rick has been gone from Beth\'s life for quite a long time. [Fridge Horror](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror"){.twikilink} kicks in when you think about how Rick could have hopped onto another reality, considering his general lack of emotion over crossing into a new one in Rick Potion \#9. If this is true, then what happened to Rick\'s original timeline?
    -   On the other hand, it could simply be prime Rick\'s memory of holding an infant Morty from some other reality.
        -   Or maybe Rick did visit when Morty was a baby but was never around after that. Beth did mention he tended to be gone and then come back when she was younger.
-   Another one for \"Close Rick-Counters\": Was the Morty controlling evil!Rick evil all along? Or did he perhaps only become evil after years of abuse from evil!Rick, killing him rather than becoming a compliant tool like so many other Morties?
    -   Considering what

        Morty did

        in The Rickshank Redemption, that\'s a strong possibility.

-   The Jerry daycare in \"Mortynight Run\", where Rick and Morty pairs drop off their Jerrys when they go on adventures. However, sometimes, a Jerry\'s Rick and Morty never comes back, leaving them stranded in an alien dimension with no way home, and their only alternatives are either to live in the daycare for the rest of their lives, or brave the dangerous alien city outside. Also, the reasons for why a Rick and Morty never come to pick up their Jerry. Which is worse, them being killed during one of their adventures, or just abandoning Jerry to his fate? Also, how are those universe\'s versions of Beth and Summer reacting?
    -   Probably with [indifference](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy"){.twikilink}, because nobody really seems to care about [Jerry](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey"){.twikilink}.
    -   If you look closely, one of the checkboxes on the clipboard Rick signs is whether Jerry\'s stay is temporary or \"forever.\" For all we know, the Ricks and Morties belonging to the left-behind Jerries could all be alive and well, having simply booted their Jerry from their lives.
        -   This grants another interesting perspective: considering Beth is depicted in many episodes as \"looking for the door\" in her marriage, what if she\'d put them up to the task?
        -   there was one person in the daycare that wasn\'t a Jerry who explained that his earth\'s Beth remarried, could one Beth have done it twice.
-   Fart\'s [David Bowie](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie"){.twikilink}-esque \"Goodbye Moonmen\" song is a nice little tune that could easily have been an extra track on [Space Oddity](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpaceOddity"){.twikilink} or [The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars"){.twikilink}, but then you realize that is actually about his wish to genocide the disease he views carbon-based life as.
    -   Soooo, it still sounds like an extra track on a Bowie album? Some of that Ziggy Stardust/Diamond Dogs, apocalypse fun?
    -   It also makes his murder of the authorities chasing him far more disturbing. He made them slowly kill each other like dominos just by mentally destroying one\'s will to live. Imagine several millions of his species invading and destroying mankind simply by breaking them via [Mind Rape](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape"){.twikilink}.
-   So, Blim Blam the Korblok was chained up by Rick so that the latter could cure his [\"Space-AIDs\"](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague"){.twikilink}, but ended up breaking free and leaving the planet due to Beth and Jerry. His Space-AIDs was never cured, and who knows what all species it could infect?
-   Rick\'s

    suicide attempt

    at the end of \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\" becomes even sadder when you consider that, given Rick\'s usual mental state,

    he\'s probably tried to kill himself a lot. Indeed, the only reason he seems to be alive is that when he wants to kill himself, he\'s in such a bad state that he\'s physically unable to actually pull it off; at no point does he decide to keep living. And, because the method he uses is indistinguishable from the rest of his sci-fi stuff, his family presumably doesn\'t realize what he keeps doing and how close to death he\'s come. Jerry even sees the machine in a drawer and briefly holds the inanimate \"test\" specimen without comment.

    -   This is seen in the very first scene of the pilot episode when Rick abducts Morty from his bed and flies off with him, telling him he\'s going to start over.

        Rick got drunk and that\'s all that was needed for Rick to want to start life on Earth over. The only person he wanted to save was Morty and his (Morty\'s) crush, Jessica. He also tells Morty that he isn\'t interested in Jessica and Morty doesn\'t have to worry about that. Could that be because Rick isn\'t planning on staying alive with them?

-   Summer has a flashback during \"Total Rick-all\" to walking in on Beth drunk alone. Beth smacks her with the wine on accident. It\'s picture day, meaning Summer will have a bruise in her class photo. Based on the casual way Beth grabs make-up to cover up the bruise, has she done this to Summer or Morty before? Or, since we know Rick is an [alcoholic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic"){.twikilink}, did he do something similar to Beth when she was a child? It\'s also possible that Beth was being so casual because she was so drunk and when you\'re drunk, apathy tends to set in.
-   Rick is frequently drunk and Beth is seen drinking wine whenever [she\'s in a bad emotional situation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows"){.twikilink}. It\'s safe to say that alcoholism runs in the family, meaning Summer and Morty are susceptible to it.
-   Compare the youthful, smiling Rick as seen in the pictures at Birdman\'s house to the Rick we see in the series just to fully realise how much life has beaten out of him.
-   It's easy to miss, but in "Get Schwifty" one of the Cromulons mentions their Planet Talent show is in its 900th season. Which means they've been at it for (depending on their units of time measurement) the better part of a millennium. And if the format has remained consistent, they've annihilated **3,600** inhabited planets. Holy shit.
-   Rick destroyed Zeep\'s miniverse the moment he arrived back in the microverse. He just destroyed two whole universes and committed genocide on at least two sentient species.
    -   That is not correct. Rick mentions when they get back to the \"real\" world that Zeep has a choice: either the battery will work, or Rick will get a new battery. He turns the key and the car starts, meaning Zeep made his choice to not tell everyone the truth. [The Stinger](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger"){.twikilink} even shows Zeep looking up at the sky and muttering \"peace among worlds, Rick!\" However, Rick basically stated that he would destroy an entire world of sentient beings if they didn\'t get back on the \"floobleboxes,\" and Zeep knew it. Imagine meeting your creator and realizing that a. He has zero empathy for you and your kind, and b. he **will** destroy you if you don\'t get back to work. Brrrr!
        -   You misread. Rick did not destroy the microverse, but he did destroy the miniverse and the teenyverse when he and Zeep got back to the microverse that Rick originally created. So the OP\'s point still stands: He destroyed two entire universes and any life within them. And it\'s not the only time he\'s done this, if we take Toxic Rick\'s batteries into consideration- that\'s at least four, and no way to know how many times he\'s done it.
    -   That\'s not the worst of it. The floobleboxes are completely necessary. Any planet\'s total energy output cannot be greater than the amount of energy it receives. So basically, the output Zeep\'s people is a fraction of what the planet\'s total energy output could be. And that is a fraction of what comes from its star. Basically, Rick could have had a much more powerful battery if he siphoned energy from the micro sun. That would require no enslavement and be more efficient. Considering Rick is a super genius, he knows this. But he created that universe and those people, installing himself as a god to them. It actually tells a lot about Rick\'s psychology. He created the only god he could believe in: a selfish, uncaring monster whose reasons for creating the universe are not only unfathomable to his creations, but ultimately makes them all cogs in an uncaring machine.
    -   Tells you a lot about [the scientists who made further universes](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent"){.twikilink} down the road even though [they](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite"){.twikilink} are aware of the little tidbit regarding the sun, [didn\'t they](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe"){.twikilink}?
-   Several of the married couples on Nuptia 4 in \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\" get killed. What if they had children who are now orphaned?
-   Was

    Jerry\'s traumatic experience with rape when he was younger

    what made him the low self-esteemed man he is today?

-   Morty and the family\'s more Jerkass tendencies in the second season could be very well what Unity said; Rick just sucks everyone down with him. And with Morty, he\'s starting get more and more like Rick.
-   Nothing is likely to come of it since both shows belong to two different networks, but [Bill Cipher](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls"){.twikilink} is [on a computer monitor![](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif){width="12" height="12"}](http://i.imgur.com/7b9G1kQ.png){.urllink}◊ at the couple\'s therapy center. It seems like an innocuous [Easter Egg](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg"){.twikilink} at first, but bear in mind that the alien doctor speaking with Beth and Jerry has the same eye designs as someone [possessed](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession"){.twikilink} by Bill.
    -   In addition, a picture of Bill and a picture of the logo for Journal 3 are shown in a [Rickstaverse photo inside a Galactic Federation Prison![](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif){width="12" height="12"}](http://somekindofgravityfallsblog.tumblr.com/post/130568788961/as-part-of-the-rick-and-morty-rickstaverse-with){.urllink}, alongside Grunkle Stan\'s notebook, pen, and mug that got sucked through a portal in Society of the Blind Eye/Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind. If anything, this means that not only are the Gravity Falls and Rick and Morty universes are connected to each other but that [Bill](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination"){.twikilink} [Cipher](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac"){.twikilink} could enter Rick and Morty dimension to do whatever ungodly horrors he wants.
    -   and if he met Rick? I don't know what's worse, if they fight and end up possibly destroying the universe, or if they get along
-   Rick is in prison:

    he probably won\'t be given alcohol and uncontrolled detoxification affects alcoholic people in a bad way.

-   When you realize that one of the reasons Rick so gleefully destroys his clones in \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\" is because he is suicidal, and murdering his clones literally allows him to destroy himself.
    -   One has to wonder if Ricks killing Ricks are a common thing.
        -   Seeing as the Council of Ricks decided to intervene only after what they called an \"untypical high death rate\" for Ricks across dimensions, the occasional Rickteside seems to be the norm.
-   [The Stinger](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger"){.twikilink} at the end of \"Meseeks And Destroy\" shows one of the villagers discovering

    King Jellybean\'s perverted history, and deciding to cover it up so as not to disillusion the community. King Jellybean was at least killed beforehand, what if he was still alive, and said villager was willing to cover for him and let him keep getting away with his crimes for the sake of publicity. It\'s even more disturbing because this has happened in REAL LIFE, with celebrities having their crimes ignored and hidden for decades or even until their death and so go unpunished and even celebrated. This creepy cartoon is actually the [Lighter and Softer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter"){.twikilink} variation.

-   After being put in prison, Rick is asked \"What are you in for?\"

    His response: \"Everything.\" This could be interpreted as being hyperbole, but it could otherwise mean that Rick has committed **every crime in the universe.** One wonders what fucked-up things he might have done outside of the episodes released so far. It also can be interpreted as his general remorse with everything he has done in life, not just illegal actions.

-   At the end of 'Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind' Rick gets a 'Free Replacement Morty' voucher. Considering all the hundreds of now freed, Rickless Mortys this is at best a cheap gift and at worst means the council burns through Mortys at an alarming rate.
    -   For there to be any free Mortys to give away, they presumably need to be Poor Rickless Bastards, which means they burn through Ricks at an alarming rate too. Or they\'re just trying to offload all of the Mortys that they suddenly found themselves burdened with.
        -   Or clones. Remember that Ricks can buy Morties in blister packs with different accessories.
    -   Given Rick\'s self-destructive tendencies, it\'s entirely possible that a substantial number of these Morties are \"available\" due to Ricks dying from suicide or accidental deaths. Which raises another question: Are these Morties ones recovered off of their home Earths, like the ones in \'Close Rick-counters\', or does the council abduct them from their families?
-   Mr. Meeseeks as beings are in constant pain while still alive, and the only reason they wish to complete their task is to end the pain. Meeseeks are suicidal.
    -   Meeseeks and destroy is really an episode about how living with a purpose is far worse than living without one.
    -   What slightly lessens the horrifying nature of this (or makes it worse depending on your viewpoint) is that it doesn\'t specify what sort of pain the Meeseeks are in - It could just be the mental torment from the frustration of being unable to finish what they were instructed to do. If one imagines that they knew, with total certainty, the meaning of life, but were unable to achieve it, one can probably imagine the intense mental strain this would put on someone. Insanity would be near certain.
        -   Until you decide you\'re perfectly happy living your own life and getting your own meaning from it, to hell with fulfilling any meaning determined by someone else.
    -   Here\'s a thought: What happens to a Meeseeks who fails to complete his task, and ends up trapped or imprisoned somehow? Like in that Federation prison where everyone is kept immobilized all the time?
-   In \"Pilot\" what exactly drove Rick to the point that he was willing to wipe out humanity with a bomb?!!!!
    -   Rick is basically one bad day away from wiping humanity then going to another universe to start over. That fact alone is scarier than just about anything the show has produced. Wouldn\'t blame any viewer if they consider Rick a [Villain Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist"){.twikilink}
    -   Not only this. The first scene of the pilot is one big fridge horror in itself. While Rick later changed his mind, he passed out right before the call of the detonation. Viewing the show for the first time, you might assume that it\'s just a joke, fitting for the black comedy of an adult show. But later in the show, it\'s revealed that there are indeed multiple universes with an infinite number of Ricks and Mortys. So how big is the chance, that this Rick and Morty were alternative versions of the \"real\" Rick and Morty who were blown up offscreen for real, along with the whole world?
    -   Morty\'s also had to disarm so many neutron bombs that he knows the percentage that will turn out to be duds, too. \'40%\' would require at least five with two duds.
-   Rick

    gives a tip to the Galactic Federation under Jerry\'s name

    . Who\'s to say this won\'t end up reaching the rest of the family\'s ears? It\'s unlikely that Beth will believe Jerry

    when he says it wasn\'t him

    . If that\'s true, Beth will likely never forgive Jerry for taking Rick away from her.

    -   Supported by [The Reveal](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal"){.twikilink} in \"The Rickshank Redemption\" that

        the entire reason Rick turned himself in and overthrew the Galactic Federation was to sabotage Jerry and Beth\'s marriage. This was probably his backup plan in case they did not go through with the divorce.

-   The interdimensional goggles seem cool at first. Imagine seeing the lives of your alternate selves from other dimensions. But imagine if your alternative selves also had them. They could see through your eyes while you work, interact with your loved ones, and have sex.
-   In the promotion for the Rick and Morty Season 1 DVD, Rick summons a Meeseeks and tells it to \'go out into the world and tell everyone about the DVD\'. Rick told the Meseeks to tell EVERYONE about the DVD, as in every single person on the planet. Then the Meeseeks is shown wandering a city in our world, spreading the news\...
-   The idea of Unity is already pretty horrifying without needing a trip to the fridge, but it\'s downplayed a bit in the episode in question when it\'s revealed that the people she has taken over would include sex offenders and engage in race wars without her taking over. However, she\'s trying to gain membership to the Galactic Federation so she can take over those planets. Given one of the first things she does is declare world peace and given the apparent parallels to Star Trek\'s Federation, it\'s likely that achieving a certain level of cultural advancement and eliminating various social problems is required before a planet can enter the Federation. In other words, if she got into this Federation she\'d be taking over peaceful planets.
    -   To add another layer of horror, all of the \'fun\' they\'re having is through the use of sentient beings, none of whom were likely consulted before being used by an alien hive mind and a sociopathic scientist as a relationship aid. How many of the redheads in that stadium would have said \"no\" [if they could?](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream"){.twikilink}
-   The destruction of the Council of Ricks in \"The Rickshank Redemption\" does not immediately garner sympathy, considering the behavior of the majority of its membership, until one remembers that Rick J 19 Z 7 (aka \"Doofus Rick\") from \"Close Encounters of the Rick Kind\" was probably among the Ricks caught in the crossfire from the Citadel\'s [Tele-Frag](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag"){.twikilink} with the Galactic Federation\'s prison. It\'s highly likely that he was killed like the other Ricks and Mortys from \"Close Encounters of the Rick Kind\", supporting Morty\'s claims about Rick\'s collateral damage being too destructive to ignore.
    -   This may have been averted, as the \"Tall Morty\" in \"The Ricklantis Mixup\" seemed to be Doofus Rick, having the same speech patterns and look. Made a sad moment indeed when he asks if he has \"graduated to being a Rick.\"
        -   That wasn\'t Doofus rick, that was \"Slow Rick\", and he wasn\'t asking if he was graduating to being a Rick, he was asking if he passed Morty school to become a Morty. Unlike Doofus rick, he is legitimately unintelligent, and kept as a \"Tall Morty\" more or less for his own safety. They look completely different (Slow Rick is a generic Rick, Doofus Rick has a unique character design).
-   Bird Person\'s [Undying Loyalty](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty"){.twikilink}, and in fact all of Rick\'s relationships, comes into question given how dependent Beth and Summer are. Who\'s to say Rick hasn\'t conditioned any of his other friends to be so loyal? Unity, a literal assimilating hive mind, states he outperforms her in assimilating people and she can only get out by cutting off contact with him. The only ones that can escape the spell of Rick\'s (pathologically sociopathic) [charisma](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard"){.twikilink} are inhuman beings that can avoid him and people [Too Dumb to Fool](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool"){.twikilink} who are powerless to go against him, like Jerry.
    -   What\'s worse, \"Morty\'s Mind-Blowers\" reveals that Rick can remove memories from his loved ones if he wants to. Who\'s to say that he hasn\'t done the same to people outside of his family?
-   In \"Pickle Rick,\" Dr. Wong is not even slightly fazed, annoyed, or otherwise adversely affected by the turmoil of Rick\'s family. Even when Rick waltzes in, soaked with blood, feces, and you know, being a pickle, she doesn\'t so much as raise her voice or lift an eyebrow. Just what kind of horrific patients does she have to deal with, to be completely unfazed by this supernatural mess of a family?
    -   In a more hopeful interpretation, since alien lifeforms have made their presence known twice over in season two, she\'s just more openminded to once-thought impossible things.
    -   Also on a hopeful note, her behavior is consistent with how [a professional psychologist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic"){.twikilink} [\'\'should\'\'](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic"){.twikilink} [behave when dealing with difficult patients](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic"){.twikilink}. While some less professional psychologists might reciprocate their patients\' more toxic behavior, Dr. Wong\'s [utter nonchalance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious"){.twikilink} in the face of the Smith family\'s absurd home life is perfectly in line with what\'s expected of her.
-   In \"Vindicators 3: Return of the Worldender\", it\'s shown the Vindicators will absolutely turn on each other the moment things get rough and they exterminated an entire planet on their previous adventure. Who\'s to say they didn\'t kill the other three Vindicators themselves during the adventure?
-   In [The Stinger](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger"){.twikilink} of \"Anatomy Park\", we learn that Ethan

    has the new Anatomy Park (Anatomy World if you will) being built inside of him.

    Now, what happens to it in \"The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy\" when Morty

    monstrously mutates Ethan with the Morphizer-XE?

    -   Considering the events of Rick Potion \#9,

        those are two different Ethans

        so it depends on whether or not

        the new Ethan has an Anatomy Park in him.

        -   Rick says the current universe is exactly the same as the previous one except they\'re both dead. New Ethan probably has an anatomy park.
        -   [and besides the original Ethan is a Chronenberg now.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail"){.twikilink}

-   Throughout the show, there are multiple major signs that

    Rick has repeatedly switched dimensions after making big mistakes so he can start over by pretending to be part of whatever version of the Sanchez family he finds there. There\'s no way to be sure the Rick we\'re watching now is the same one the show started with. He may have even killed other Ricks just so he could take their place &, if he hasn\'t some other Rick could do it to him at any time.

    -   For what it\'s worth, the Citadel of Ricks still identify our Rick as Rick C-137. Granted, they\'re hardly infallible, our Rick never contradicts them in any way.
        -   [Fridge Horror](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror"){.twikilink} again-Morty claims he\'s from C-137, but is never identified as such by any Rick other than Rick C-137. It\'s possible Rick could be lying to him.
        -   It\'s fairly well conclusive that our Morty is not C-137. Rick C-137 has memories of baby Morty, when our Beth said that Rick had been gone for 20 years. Best bets are that \"Evil Morty\" is the real Morty C-137, out to get revenge on Rick C-137.

-   Let\'s consider a specific sentence from the episode \"Pickle Rick\", one that Dr. Wong told Rick near the end of the episode. \"You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force, and as an inescapable curse.\" Now consider the fact that the characters in Rick and Morty have stated multiple times that there is an infinite amount of universes, with an infinite amount of Ricks. Which means that, while most of the Ricks that we see have embraced science and portal gun technology, there exists Ricks in many universes that have never taken that plunge, instead focusing on their wife and their child, Beth. The Ricks that have gone with the science route usually end up in turmoil and with existential crisis, while the ones who have gone with the family route seem to be living much happier lives in ignorant bliss. However, we\'ve only seen two Ricks in the entire series that decided on family over science: the first, in \"Rickshank Redemption\", in a memory that may or may not be true, and the second, in \"The Ricklantis Mixup\". In the first instance, after a Rick rejects the invitation to own a portal gun, he witnesses his wife and child get murdered by a bomb before his very eyes. While that story seems to have been fake to trick the agent, there\'s no actual proof that our Rick didn\'t just change the last part of the memory while the rest was the truth, or that he didn\'t just think of the time this happened to another Rick from another dimension. In the second instance, a Rick that preferred to work with wood rather than technology and was proud to raise his daughter got kidnapped, dragged to the Citadel, and forced into a [Lotus-Eater Machine](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine"){.twikilink}\...to make cookies. It seems, then, that the Ricks who have accepted science - the \"unstoppable force\" - can\'t stand the simple fact that, for all of their intelligence, some Ricks are happier than they\'ll ever be because they willingly refused to heighten their intelligence to \"inescapable curse\" levels. And so, in a fit of self hatred that no show has ever rivaled before, these Science Ricks will go out and ruin the lives of these Family Ricks, out of pure jealousy and spite.
    -   This would explain the number of jobber Ricks on the Citadel. The Ricks could easily automate most of the blue collar jobs, or bring in any kind of easily controlled worker population, but they don\'t. It wouldn\'t surprise me if, being the sociopaths they are, the Council of Ricks \"recruited\" Ricks from beyond the Central Finite Curve for no better reason than to keeping thematic.
-   Simple Rick is the only Rick we see who gave up on super-science and adventure so he could stay with his Beth\... and was then kidnapped by other Ricks who use his happy memories to make cookies. The question is, when did this happen? Simple Rick\'s happiest memory is Beth\'s third birthday. Was Simple Rick kidnapped shortly after? Is this Beth yet another Beth who grew up thinking her father abandoned her?
    -   Simple Rick\'s central thought is the simple love he felt for and from his daughter. There\'s an entire slave factory not only dedicated to making it, but so important that it has implied sister factories, a small army dedicated to its recovery, and a need for Simple Rick so great that his death requires an immediate replacement. Not only is Simple Rick\'s based on a [Lotus-Eater Machine](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine"){.twikilink}, it mass-produces lotus-flavored candy for the uncountable number of Ricks who want but cannot get the love of their Beths.
    -   [Justified](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope"){.twikilink} in that Old Rick (a.k.a. Assembly Line/Worker Rick) was [harvested for his memories](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack"){.twikilink} [mere moments](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotToMindTheirHead "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotToMindTheirHead"){.twikilink} [after they happened,](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutPunch"){.twikilink} [which could mean\...](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty"){.twikilink}
    -   You have to remember that all the Ricks are the same age, so Simple Rick would have been kidnapped, at earliest, sometime after the Citadel was founded, which was probably at least a few years after Ricks started dimension travelling. Also, the Citadel probably didn\'t have any Mortys until just a few years ago.
-   Simple Rick was blatantly kidnapped to be milked for cookie flavoring, but a number of other Ricks and Morties in the episode appear to be on the citadel against their own wishes. Notably Cop Morty who broke down in tears over wanting to be a normal boy before performing a [Suicide by Cop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop"){.twikilink}, and the Rick attempting to concoct portal fluid in a meth lab for the Morty gang. At the end of \"Close Rickcounters of the Rick Kind\", Evil Morty was shuttled back to his home dimension along with all the Morties he held prisoner, yet he\'s back on the citadel still Rickless. Could the shadow council have rounded all those Morties back up to repopulate the citadel, along with any aberrant Ricks who never mastered interdimensional travel?
-   Worker Rick is forced to act as a replacement for Simple Rick after he gets him killed, which is bad enough on it's own, but then at the end of the episode

    Evil/President Morty has Wonka Rick (who owned the factory) killed

    . Seeing as President Morty has already enacted major changes in the citadel such as changing the Morty school curriculum and getting the teacher fired, it's not hard to believe the Simple Rick factory might end up shut down. If this is true, ''what will happen to worker Rick?''

    -   Cop Morty was just trying to put Cop Rick off his guard, in the exact same way that Crib Room Morty had earlier in the episode.

-   The [People Zoo](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleZoo"){.twikilink} in \"Morty\'s Mind Blowers\" has Meeseeks in it, as a [Freeze-Frame Bonus](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus"){.twikilink}. Meeseeks go crazy after living for only a couple of days, and God knows how long they\'ve been stuck in there.
-   In \"Morty\'s Mindblowers\", it\'s revealed

    Rick and Morty may have had to abandon another universe because of evil squirrels. This seems disturbing enough, except it\'s not stated when this took place. It\'s possible this memory is from before Rick Potion Number 9, meaning they may have had to ditch at least three universes.

    -   Not really. Rick reminds Morty what he said about switching universes, implying that this is after Rick Potion Number 9.

-   Summer has to be on

    watch for Morty\'s Mindblowers scenarios, which include her younger brother and grandfather attempting suicide. It\'s also implied that she remembers her mother choosing her life over Morty\'s, which horrified her at the time. But Rick doesn\'t wipe her mind, precisely because she has to be on call. \"I don\'t get paid enough for this shit\" suddenly takes on a darker tone.

-   In [The ABC\'s of Beth](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RickAndMortyS3E9TheABCsOfBeth "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RickAndMortyS3E9TheABCsOfBeth"){.twikilink} Rick doesn\'t just tell Beth about the things she asked him to make for her during her childhood,

    he pulls a box out from beneath his workbench and shows her the items, meaning he actually made at least some of her macabre gadgets and gave them to her to use on other people. Also he makes it clear that he wasn\'t going to reign her in, even if she needed to be reigned in.

-   Some of the toys that young Beth \"requested\" including such things as a teddy bear with realistic organs and a knife that loves stabbing. This, along with Beth\'s sociopathic tendencies, makes one consider why Beth wanted to become a surgeon. Not because of her smarts but because she likes looking at organs.
-   [The ABC\'s of Beth](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RickAndMortyS3E9TheABCsOfBeth "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RickAndMortyS3E9TheABCsOfBeth"){.twikilink} reveals why Rick has the cloning technology he had to remake Tommy and make Tiny Rick: He was prepared for when Young Beth would murder someone and he\'d need to clone them so no one found out.
-   In \"The ABC\'s of Beth\", there was no happy ending to the situation with Tommy, no matter what Beth or Rick would try. That\'s why Rick decided to go home after seeing

    Tommy\'s graphic demonstration of him sleeping with, impregnating a Froopy Land resident, and eating the resulting offspring. If Beth had managed to convince Tommy to come home, she would have had to tell his father and the authorities why she had abandoned him in her childhood chicken coop for thirty years. Tommy would have stuck to his story that Beth deliberately drowned and abandoned him because she was jealous of his relationship with his dad. Even if Beth had lawyered up or the statute of limitations had expired, Tommy has lost his sanity living alone, being forced into bestiality, incest and cannibalism to stay alive, and believing his best friend betrayed him. He is also extremely violent, and he would need a lot of rehabilitation. All in all, Beth and Rick cloning Tommy was the least harmful decision because it means Tommy\'s father never found out the truth.

-   Beth also reveals that she knew all along, thanks to her father telling her, that

    the Rick and Morty in this universe aren\'t her Rick and Morty. They\'re fugitives from another dimension while the father she knew is dead. Rick had absolutely no reason to reveal this to her, except to explain why he\'s being obtuse about his parenting skills and admitting that Beth is expendable to him. All Beths are the same, in his words, and there are more Mortys that she could have with her original son having disappeared

    .

-   Had Rick just gone to family therapy with his daughter and grandchildren like he was supposed to, instead of ending up having a solo adventure and allying with Jaguar, Jaguar wouldn\'t have rescued him and Morty in [The Stinger](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger"){.twikilink} of \"Pickle Rick\" and they both would\'ve [suffered](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode"){.twikilink} a [Cruel and Unusual Death](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath"){.twikilink}. Remember that Rick was genuinely out of ideas and believed they were going to die. Talk about a [Family-Unfriendly Aesop](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop"){.twikilink}\...
    -   Though to be fair, Rick\'s extreme adverse to boredom, as pointed out by Dr. Wong, is a dangerous problem to the family. For all we know, it was completely his fault that they were in that problem in the first place.
-   Evil Morty

    \'s \[\[Main/Leifmotif leitmotif\]\], For the Damaged Coda, has the best possible name. It has only ever been played at the ends of episodes, making it a literal coda, and it\'s the leitmotif of

    the most damaged Morty of them all

    .

-   Beth in episode Morty\'s Mind Blowers show that an alien villain forcing Beth into a Sadistic Choice to choose which one of her children he\'ll spare and Beth immediately chooses Summer, not even hesitating for a second to resign Morty to death. What does that say about Beth character. This is not the first time Beth show no regard for Morty\'s life, in the stinger of Rick Potion \#9, Beth tells Jerry she doesn\'t care about what might have happened to Rick and Morty and now that they have gone, she feels finally happy. Why do you think she feel like that about Morty, originally The show for the most part has shown Beth to be loving to Morty, or at the very least not abusive, while she and Summer have had a much more fraught relationship because Summer learning that Beth wanted to abort her and still has resentment about Jerry knocking her up and having a shotgun wedding, I was thinking that maybe it the divorce and how relationship with Rick and Jerry that cause her resentment to Morty, when she said that Beth tells Jerry she doesn\'t care about what might have happened to Rick and Morty and now that they have gone, she feels finally happy, what if when her relationship with Jerry was fix, maybe she thought she did not need Rick anymore now she had Jerry and maybe she saw Morty as Jerry former weakness and insecurities, and now that are Beth the chose Rick over Jerry is regretting how decision and is blaming Morty because she see him as a mix of the worst traits of Rick and Jerry, she did say in episode Raising Gazorpazorp that she believes that Morty was filled with Jerry\'s insecurities as a result of Jerry\'s overly-nurturing method of raising him.
-   Rick doesn\'t take his entire lab with him when he and Morty bail on the pilot universe. That means all of the memories in Morty\'s Mind Blowers were extracted from a different Morty altogether. We know from Mortynight Run that any given pair of Ricks and Mortys can have entirely different experiences even if they start out on their adventures in the exact same way. Those memories couldn\'t all have been extracted from the Morty we know, and since Rick gives the memory tubes nonsense filenames, he can\'t be certain whether any given memory is actually one that his Morty has had removed. Morty may have remembered a bunch of horrible things that didn\'t happen to him.
    -   Likewise\... does Morty remember Mr. Jellybean? Or did he have Rick remove that memory for him?
        -   Most likely, he did not have that memory removed. Why? Because he never found out that Rick knew about Mr. Jellybean and killed him. Morty believes that Rick doesn\'t know what happened and if he DID know, he would just use that knowledge to mock him and \"I told you so\" him. For the same reason, he probably didn\'t have him remove the memory of what happened with Fart.
-   There is a feature at Rickworld that allows him to massacre a room full of Morty's.
    -   Rick does it every three months so that he can stand being around his Morty.
