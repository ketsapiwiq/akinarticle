In the 2002 [speech](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99591469) against the Iraq War that helped [propel him to the presidency](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/02/AR2007100202036.html), then-state Sen. Barack Obama denounced not just the looming invasion of Iraq, but also human rights abuses by our "so-called allies" in Saudi Arabia:

> Let's fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of terrorist cells.

And he spoke out against the U.S.' role as weapons supplier to the world:

> Let's fight to make sure ... that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe.

Thirteen years later, Obama is making his fourth trip to Riyadh, having presided over record-breaking U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia while offering only muted criticism of the kingdom's human rights violations.

And don't expect the president to speak up while he's there. Obama last traveled to Saudi Arabia in January 2015, cutting short his trip to India after the passing of the former Saudi king, Abdullah ibn-Abdulaziz al-Saud. During that visit, Obama was [criticized](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-saudi-arabia-flogging-20150127-story.html) for not speaking out against the flogging of prominent Saudi blogger and dissident Raif Badawi. In 2014, Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for "insulting Islam" and "going beyond the realm of obedience," with the first flogging session taking place weeks before Obama arrived.

In January, after a [record-setting year](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/saudi-arabia-2015-beheadings-20-years-151110052520862.html) for Saudi beheadings, Saudi authorities set off protests by [executing](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-executes-47-including-top-shiite-cleric-1355312477) Shia cleric and regime critic Nimr al-Nimr. U.S. response was muted. The State Department merely said the execution "risks exacerbating sectarian tensions at a time when they urgently need to be reduced" --- and then fell silent on the repression of the following protests.

Last year, amazingly enough, Saudi Arabia became the head of the 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council. When a State Department spokesperson was asked for his reaction, he [responded](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/09/247169.htm#SAUDIARABIA): "Frankly, we would welcome it. We're close allies."

Obama administration officials have not offered on-the-record explanations for why Saudi human rights abuses don't play a greater role in U.S. policy. But in the trove of documents released from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server, Clinton acknowledges that the U.S. government holds the Saudis to a different standard.

In [one email chain](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/221/DOC_0C05789037/C05789037.pdf), dated June 22, 2011, aide Cheryl Mills forwarded Clinton a New York Times opinion [column](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/opinion/22dowd.html?_r=0) in which Maureen Dowd mused that it would "have been thrilling" if Clinton, on a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, had "smacked around the barbaric Saudi men who force women to huddle under a suffocating black tarp." Clinton asked Mills what she thought about the column and Mills remarked that "we/DOS/USG may have different standards we apply when it is pushing Saudi." "No doubt about that!" Clinton responded:
