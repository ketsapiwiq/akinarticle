The good news is that Google Sets is still available as a Google Sheets feature. Create a new spreadsheet in *mazda* in A1 and *honda* in A2 (the first column), highlight the two cells and then press Ctrl (or Option for Mac) while clicking and dragging the small blue box from the lower-right corner to select additional cells where to place the Google Sets results.\

{ Thanks,

Missing Google Sets? It\'s one of the first Google Labs projects and [it was discontinued last year](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/08/google-sets-will-be-shut-down.html) . Google Sets allowed you to generate lists of similar items by just typing a few examples.The good news is that Google Sets is still available as a Google Sheets feature. Create a new spreadsheet in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) , typein A1 andin A2 (the first column), highlight the two cells and then press Ctrl (or Option for Mac) while clicking and dragging the small blue box from the lower-right corner to select additional cells where to place the Google Sets results.Google Sets included 22 new car brands: BMW, Ford, Toyota and many others. You can also use Google Sets to quickly generate lists of dog breeds, U2 songs, French writers, tech sites and more.{ Thanks, [Philipp](http://outer-court.com/) and [Jérôme](https://plus.google.com/117598418867899518106/posts) . }
