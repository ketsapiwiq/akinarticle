That image of the heroic deer's head mounted as a trophy in some dude's parlor is but one of many possible scenarios depicted in animator Jeff Hong's Tumblr [Unhappily Ever After](http://disneyunhappilyeverafter.tumblr.com). Each day, Hong, an artist at Nickelodeon, posts new and childhood-recontextualizing images of beloved Disney cartoon characters getting run over by the freight train of reality. It's not as though we haven't seen these characters [go dark](https://www.fastcompany.com/1681306/disney-goes-dark-in-a-demented-new-exhibit) before either in cartoons or [mixed in to our world](https://www.fastcompany.com/1683380/disney-princesses-turn-deadly-in-this-killer-interactive-street-art). The images on Unhappily Ever After are just a little bit more anchored by real-life sadness. Pocahontas here is not the [killer warrior](https://www.fastcompany.com/1681306/disney-goes-dark-in-a-demented-new-exhibit) we've seen before, but rather a casino employee. I don't know if I can bare to find out what condition Nemo from Finding Nemo is in, or if he's ever even found.

Have a look at more of these images in the slides above.
