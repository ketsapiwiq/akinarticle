A day after Microsoft introduced an innocent Artificial Intelligence chat robot to Twitter it has had to delete it after it transformed into an evil Hitler-loving, incestual sex-promoting, \'Bush did 9/11\'-proclaiming robot. 

Developers at [Microsoft](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/microsoft) created \'Tay\', an AI modelled to speak \'like a teen girl\', in order to improve the customer service on their voice recognition software. They marketed her as \'The AI with zero chill\' - and that she certainly is.
