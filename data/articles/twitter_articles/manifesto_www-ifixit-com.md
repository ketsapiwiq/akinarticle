Let\'s take back our right to repair!
=====================================

Help us get this manifesto posted in every workshop, hacker space, and garage in the world!

Put it up everywhere
====================

Print it out or get a copy from us, then take a geotagged photo and add it to our [flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/ifixit/) with the tag manifesto. We\'ll make a map of the results and post it here. Let\'s take the fight against obsolescence to the streets!

We\'re giving them away for (nearly) free
=========================================

We really, really want people to read this manifesto. So much so that we printed up some awe-inspiring posters---and we want to mail you one! It\'s almost free, just pay for shipping! Head [over here](http://www.ifixit.com/Apple-Parts/Self-Repair-Manifesto/IF179-020) to order.

Join the cause!
===============

We are building a [free repair manual](/Guide) for every device. That\'s a monumental undertaking, but we\'re making great progress, one photo at a time. We\'d love your help!

iFixit is the free repair manual that you can edit. We are a community of people helping each other fix stuff. Come hang out with us---you\'ll find a friendly, helpful bunch of people who care about things and want to make them last longer.

Print your own
==============
