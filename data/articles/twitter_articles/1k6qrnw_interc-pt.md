Saudi Arabia Uses Terrorism As An Excuse for Human Rights Abuses

By Arjun Sethi

Reports emerged last week that Saudi Arabia intends to imminently execute more than 50 people on a single day for alleged terrorist crimes.

Although the kingdom hasn't officially confirmed the reports, the evidence is building. Okas, [the first outlet to publish the report](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-executions-kingdom-to-behead-50-men-convicted-of-terrorism-offences-despite-threat-of-a6750631.html), has close ties to the Saudi Ministry of Interior and would not have published the story without obtaining government consent. Some of the prisoners slated for execution were likewise recently subject to [an unscheduled medical exam](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/11/saudi-arabia-execution-looms-for-at-least-50-on-death-row/), a sign that many believe portends imminent execution. There has already been [a spike in capital punishment in Saudi Arabia this year](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/11/saudi-arabia-151-executed-this-year-in-highest-recorded-toll-in-nearly-two-decades/), with at least 151 executions, compared with 90 for all of 2014.

[The cases of six Shia activists from Awamiya](http://www.esohr.org/en/?p=685), a largely Shia town in the oil-rich Eastern province, are particularly disconcerting. The majority of Saudi's minority Shia population is concentrated in the Eastern province and has long faced government persecution. The six activists were convicted for protesting this mistreatment and other related crimes amid the Arab uprisings in 2011. Three of them were arrested when they were juveniles. [Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-executions-kingdom-to-behead-50-men-convicted-of-terrorism-offences-despite-threat-of-a6750631.html), a prominent Shia religious leader who was convicted of similar charges, also faces imminent execution.

All the convictions were obtained through [unfair trials marred by human and civil rights violations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/11/saudi-arabia-execution-looms-for-at-least-50-on-death-row/), including in some cases torture, forced confessions and lack of access to counsel. Each defendant was tried before the Specialized Criminal Court, a counterterrorism tribunal controlled by the Ministry of Interior that has [few procedural safeguards](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/10/saudi-arabia-cleric-who-backed-protests-trial-his-life) and is often used to persecute political dissidents. Lawyers are generally prohibited from counseling their clients during interrogation and have limited participatory rights at trial. Prosecutors aren't even required to disclose the charges and relevant evidence to defendants.

The problems aren't just procedural. Saudi law criminalizes dissent and the expression of fundamental civil rights. [Under an anti-terrorism law passed in 2014](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/saudi-arabia), for example, individuals may be executed for vague acts such as participating in or inciting protests, "contact or correspondence with any groups ... or individuals hostile to the kingdom" or "calling for atheist thought."

One of the defendants, Ali al-Nimr, was [convicted of crimes](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/25/opinions/coogle-saudi-arabia-death-sentence/) such as "breaking allegiance with the ruler" and "going out to a number of marches, demonstrations and gathering against the state and repeating some chants against the state." For these offenses, he has been sentenced to beheading and crucifixion, with his beheaded body to be put on public display as a warning to others.

Because of these procedural and legal abominations, the planned executions for these Shia activists must not proceed. They should be retried in public proceedings and afforded due process protections consistent with international law, which includes a ban on the death penalty for anyone under the age of 18.

No other executions should take place in Saudi Arabia. Capital punishment is morally repugnant and rife with error and bias, as we know all too well in the United States. Moreover, any outcome produced by the Saudi criminal justice system is inherently suspect. Inadequate due process, violations of basic human rights and draconian laws that criminalize petty offenses and exercising of civil rights [are fixtures of Saudi rule](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/saudi-arabia).
