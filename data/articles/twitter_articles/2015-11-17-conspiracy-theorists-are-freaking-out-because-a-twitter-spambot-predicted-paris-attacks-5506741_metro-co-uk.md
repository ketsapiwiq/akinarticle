**The entire world has been reeling since the awful attacks on Paris on Friday night.**

But one particular Twitter spambot account appeared to predict the multiple terror attacks, days before they actually occurred.

On the 11th of November -- two days before France's capital was targeted -- \@PzBooks tweeted: 'BREAKING: Death toll from Paris terror attack rises to at least 120 with 270 others injured.'

And people are, understandably, pretty freaked out about the tweet.

Plenty of people took the Twitter to voice their concerns, with some even labelling it a 'false flag' -- a term used by conspiracy theorists for an act they think has been staged by a government or other authority.

But there's actually a reasonable explanation (which is a lot less terrifying than governments staging their own terror attacks).

The \@PZBooks account is a spambot that regurgitates actual news from \@PZF --Â which is an actual breaking news account.

\@PZBooks appears to have taken two official \@PZF breaking news tweets -- one dating back to January's Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris and the other from an attack on a Nigerian mosque.

The account has scrambled the events and death toll together to create the alarming 'prediction'.

**Here are the two original tweets:**

> AFP: Death toll from Nigerian mosque attack rises to at least 120 with 270 others injured <http://t.co/fa9Q7aRZHx>
>
> --- Breaking News Feed (\@pzf) [November 28, 2014](https://twitter.com/pzf/status/538422123094888448)

> BREAKING NEWS: Death toll from Paris terror attack rises to at least 12 -- Reuters
>
> --- Breaking News Feed (\@pzf) [January 7, 2015](https://twitter.com/pzf/status/552801974991998976)

**And here's the fake 'prediction':**
