So hearing or reading "Hillary for Prison" or "Never Trump," for someone who disagrees, becomes a matter of defending turf rather than discussing ideas. It's especially easy to get sucked into group arguments online, Maidenberg said, because the responses to a Facebook post are so intermittently rewarding. Some of the comments are positive, and some aren't. But when they agree with you, they feel so good.

The problem is, polarization is isolating. You might not want to be best friends with a political adversary, but once you've ripped each other to shreds on Facebook, it's harder to make eye contact at happy hour. Partisan hostility "deprives people of social connections and social support that they will need at some point," Maidenberg said. "It's very troubling."

So the key to winning these political arguments is this: Don't try to win them. Seriously! People [stick pretty firmly](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2010/12/you_never_forget_your_first.html) to their party affiliations. There are ways to make people less biased, but it's [really hard](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/bias-reduction/491195/) and [best done in person](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/no-wait-short-conversations-really-can-reduce-prejudice/477105/).

If you're enmeshed in an unproductive spat over, say, Europe's refugee policy, the goal should instead be to de-escalate the fracas as swiftly as possible.

That, of course, is harder than it sounds. Because these issues are so consequential, it's hard to resist wanting the last word. "If someone was to say something about broccoli, you wouldn't feel sucked into the argument," explained Anita Vangelisti, a communications professor at the University of Texas who specializes in interpersonal interactions. "But if someone gives you a strong view about something you care about, you tend to take on a defensive stance."

This isn't to say people should avoid earnest policy discussions, especially if they aim to understand the other side better or learn more about an issue. We're talking about the comments section of [this rainbow cake recipe](http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rainbow-cake-recipe-inspires-comment-apocalypse-1592575661), not [Intelligence Squared](http://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/).

Maidenberg and Vangelisti offered a cheat sheet for how to diffuse those types of conflicts---without giving up on your own beliefs:

-   If you can physically leave the situation (or close the Facebook tab), say something like, "I continue to disagree with you, but I'd prefer not to fight about it." This is savvy, Vangelisti said, because it allows you to stick to your guns while looking reasonable and well-mannered. Look at you on that high road!
-   If it's too late for that, or if you're trapped at a dinner or another setting where escape isn't possible, try asking the other person endless questions about their beliefs. "You can refocus the conversation on the person's feelings, like 'It sounds like you're really worried about terrorism, why is that?'" Vangelisti said. "Then, it can be a different conversation than banning Muslims."
-   What if their answers make clear that the sources of their facts are, to you, wrong? Maidenberg suggested acknowledging the validity of their point of view by saying, for example, "I can see that you think that, given the sources of information that you have." (Ed: This one, while perhaps the most satisfying, might get you punched in the face.)
-   Whatever you do, avoid being negative. "Negative affect reciprocity" is the tendency of people to mirror each others' anger and frustration. If you refuse to be negative back, Vangelisti said, it instantly stops the escalation. Even though it may require several deep breaths (or sips of wine) to muster the strength.
