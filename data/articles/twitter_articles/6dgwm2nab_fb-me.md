Chelsea Manning, who is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking government documents to WikiLeaks, has been threatened with possible â€œindefinite solitary confinementâ€? for a series of seemingly trivial infractions, including owning expired toothpaste and â€œsweeping food onto the floor,â€? [](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/chelsea-manning-faces-solitary-confinement-under-new-charges?utm_term=.pyKw236J7L#.eoVa07118)her lawyer said on Wednesday.

ACLU attorney Chase Strangio says Manning is additionally accused of â€œdisrespectâ€? for requesting her lawyer while speaking to a guard and â€œprohibited propertyâ€? for owning books and magazines that include the Caitlyn Jenner cover issue of Vanity Fair.

In response to the charges, Manningâ€™s supporters [](https://www.freechelsea.com/)have started an online petition providing a detailed list of her alleged violations:

[](https://www.freechelsea.com/)According to the website, Manningâ€™s â€œprohibited propertyâ€? was as follows:

> Vanity Fair issue with Caitlyn Jenner on the cover, Advocate, OUT Magazine, Cosmopolitan issue with an interview of Chelsea, Transgender Studies Quarterly, novel about trans issues â€œA Safe Girl to Love,â€? book â€œHacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy â€" The Many Faces of Anonymous,â€? book â€œI Am Malala,â€? 5 books by Robert Dorkin, legal documents including the Senate Torture Report, book: â€œHidden Qualities that Make Us Influential.â€?

â€œGiven the materials that were confiscated, it is concerning that the military and Leavenworth might be taking action for the purpose of chilling Chelseaâ€™s speech or even with the goal of silencing her altogether by placing her in solitary,â€? Strangio [](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/chelsea-manning-faces-solitary-confinement-under-new-charges?utm_term=.pyKw236J7L#.eoVa07118)told Buzzfeed News. â€œHopefully with public scrutiny the prison will respond by dismissing these charges and ensuring that she is not unfairly targeted based on her activism, her identity, and her pending lawsuit.â€?\

Manningâ€™s attorney says she is scheduled to have a hearing on the charges on August 18th.
