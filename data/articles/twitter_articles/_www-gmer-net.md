My doman DDoS-ed for the first time.

\

**2006.12.06**

I developed sample rootkit \"test.sys\" which hides its file from all public rootkit detectors:

BlackLight

Sophos ARK

RootkitRevealer

IceSword

DarkSpy

SVV

\...

GMER

Rootkit doesn\'t create hooks ( SSDT, IRP, SYSENTER, IDT, inline, FSF ) and its modifications are not visible.\
You can see it in action in these movies: [test.wmv](http://www2.gmer.net/test.wmv), [test2.wmv](http://www2.gmer.net/test2.wmv) ( 0.9MB, 0.7MB Windows Media Video 9 codec ).\
The detection of this type of rootkit will be added into the next version.

\

**2006.11.28**

Version 1.0.12.12011.

\

**2006.10.17**

New tool - [catchme](http://www2.gmer.net/catchme.htm) released.
