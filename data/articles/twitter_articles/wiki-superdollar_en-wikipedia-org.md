A **superdollar** (also known as a **superbill** or **supernote**) is a very high quality [counterfeit](/wiki/Counterfeit "Counterfeit") [United States one hundred-dollar bill](/wiki/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill "United States one hundred-dollar bill"),[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) alleged by the [U.S. Government](/wiki/United_States_Government "United States Government"){.mw-redirect} to have been made by unknown organizations or governments.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Weinberg2008-2)[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) In 2011 government sources stated that these \"counterfeit bills were in worldwide circulation from the late 1980s until at least July 2000\" in an extradition court case.[\[4\]](#cite_note-rte-20110718-4)

While there are many features on supernotes that can be detected with today\'s technology, new, more sophisticated supernotes are always being produced. No current technology can guarantee catching 100% of the supernotes in circulation.\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

Various groups have been suspected of creating such notes, and international opinion on the origin of the notes varies. The U.S. Government believes it most likely that the majority of these notes were produced in [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea").[\[5\]](#cite_note-CRS-5) Over \$35 million of \$100 bills were produced by British criminals arrested in 2002. The name derives from the fact that the quality of the notes exceeds that of the originals.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)\[*[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*\]

A new \$100 bill design intended to thwart counterfeiting, incorporating a \"3D security ribbon\", colorshifting numerals and drawings, and microprinting, entered circulation in 2013.[\[7\]](#cite_note-bep2013-7)

Production

Supernotes are said to be made with the highest quality of ink printed on a cotton/linen blend, and are designed to recreate the various security features of United States currency, such as the red and blue security fibers, the [security thread](/wiki/Security_thread "Security thread"), and the [watermark](/wiki/Watermark "Watermark"). Moreover, they are printed using an [intaglio printing process](/wiki/Intaglio_(printmaking) "Intaglio (printmaking)") or with engraved plates, the same process used by the U. S. Government for legitimate notes. In most counterfeiting, [offset printing](/wiki/Offset_printing "Offset printing") or color [inkjet](/wiki/Inkjet_printing "Inkjet printing") and [laser printing](/wiki/Laser_printing "Laser printing") are most common means of making counterfeit money.[\[8\]](#cite_note-bl-20140507-8)

Experts who have studied supernotes extensively and examined them alongside genuine bills point out that there are many different varieties of supernotes. In 2006 the \"family\" of fraudulent bills was thought to have 19 members,[\[9\]](#cite_note-mihm-9) but since 2006 producers of the supernotes have improved the product, and more varieties exist. Early versions of the fake notes, for example, lacked the bands of [magnetic ink](/wiki/Magnetic_ink "Magnetic ink"){.mw-redirect} printed in distinctive patterns on different denominations of U.S. money; later counterfeits rectified this error. Several of the inconspicuous \"mistakes\" on the first supernotes were corrected, some several times.

On the genuine \$100 bill, for example, the left base vertical line of the [lamp post](/wiki/Lamp_post "Lamp post"){.mw-redirect} near the figure on the reverse of the \$100 note is weak. The first supernotes printed this line too distinctly, rendering the counterfeit more authoritatively printed than the original. Later supernotes over-corrected this strong line by removing it altogether. Similarly, the [hands](/wiki/Hands "Hands"){.mw-redirect} of the [clock](/wiki/Clock "Clock") on [Independence Hall](/wiki/Independence_Hall "Independence Hall") on the genuine bill extend slightly beyond the inner [circle](/wiki/Circle "Circle"); on the supernotes they stop short of it.

On the front of the supernote, in the \"N\" in \"UNITED STATES\", a [slash](/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) "Slash (punctuation)") can be seen to the right of the [diagonal](/wiki/Diagonal "Diagonal") and the right ascender of the letter; there is none on the genuine note. Other differences in vignetting and in the defining lines of the top ornament in Independence Hall have been observed.\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\] [Klaus Bender](/wiki/Klaus_Bender "Klaus Bender") and others have speculated that the counterfeiters introduced these differences to be able to distinguish their product from the original, but there is no obvious way to confirm this.

Arrests of United States distributors

In two sting operations running from 2002 to 2005, dubbed \"Operation Smoking Dragon\" and \"Operation Royal Charm\", United States agents arrested at least 87 people on charges that included smuggling superdollars. About \$4.5 million in counterfeit currency was seized, much in \$100 bills. No definitive origin for the counterfeit \$100 bills was determined.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

In 2005, British criminals, [Anatasios Arnaouti](/wiki/Anatasios_Arnaouti "Anatasios Arnaouti") and four others, were convicted of conspiracy to make counterfeit currency in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"). They were arrested in 2002 after an operation that involved the [U.S. Secret Service](/wiki/U.S._Secret_Service "U.S. Secret Service"){.mw-redirect}. The counterfeit currency recovered included \$3.5 million worth of \$100 bills, which [Bank of England](/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") experts said were of excellent quality. The police stated that \"The potential to undermine the economy of the UK and US was very significant.\"[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

The printer admitted to making 350,000 \$100 bills, \$35 million, over 18 months.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14) The gang were using equipment capable of printing £1 million per day, and boasted they were producing \$500,000 in fake dollars a day.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)

North Korea

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: North Korea")

\]

It has been confirmed that [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") has passed off superdollars ([Korean](/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): *kattalio*[\[17\]](#cite_note-Cha2012-17)) in various countries. The counterfeit bills also circulate both within North Korea and around [its border with China](/wiki/China%E2%80%93North_Korea_border "China–North Korea border"). There is, however, some doubt about the reliability of [North Korean defectors](/wiki/North_Korean_defectors "North Korean defectors")\' claims,[\[5\]](#cite_note-CRS-5) on which the United States partially bases its accusations, along with [South Korean](/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea") intelligence sources.[\[5\]](#cite_note-CRS-5)

The testimony of the North Korean defectors is considered by some to be suspect, and one witness has since gone into hiding after charges that he fabricated the story for money.[\[18\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-18)[\[19\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy2-19) These witnesses claimed that the factory where the notes are printed is located in the city of [Pyongsong](/wiki/Pyongsong "Pyongsong") and is part of [Room 39](/wiki/Room_39 "Room 39").[\[9\]](#cite_note-mihm-9)

One defector had taken the notes to experts in the South Korean intelligence agency,\[*[which?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words"){.mw-redirect}*\] who did not believe that they were fakes.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20) The *[San Francisco Chronicle](/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle "San Francisco Chronicle")* interviewed a North Korean chemist who described the operation; insisting on anonymity, he spoke about the technical details of the process as well as the distribution method, which he said was through North Korean [diplomats](/wiki/Diplomats "Diplomats"){.mw-redirect} and international crime syndicates.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

The U.S. Government has theorized that the bills were spread in two ways:

Since 2004 the United States has frequently called for pressure against North Korea in an attempt to end the alleged distribution of supernotes. It has investigated the [Bank of China](/wiki/Bank_of_China "Bank of China"), [Banco Delta Asia](/wiki/Banco_Delta_Asia "Banco Delta Asia"){.mw-redirect}, and [Seng Heng Bank](/wiki/Seng_Heng_Bank "Seng Heng Bank"){.mw-redirect}.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-28)[\[29\]](#cite_note-29) The U.S. eventually prohibited Americans from banking with Banco Delta Asia.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)[\[31\]](#cite_note-31) However, an audit of the bank disputed U.S. allegations and indicated that the only time Banco Delta Asia had knowingly handled counterfeit money was in 1994 when it discovered and turned over \$10,000 in counterfeit \$100 bills to local authorities.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32) The United States has threatened North Korea with sanctions over its alleged involvement with the supernotes, though it said those sanctions would be a separate issue from the [nuclear sanctions](/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea "Sanctions against North Korea").

South Korea has attempted to play a middle role, encouraging all parties to reach an acceptable conclusion without animosity.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-28) In a major meeting on January 22, 2006, the U.S. laid out its evidence and tried to persuade the Seoul government to take a harder line on the issue and impose similar financial sanctions, but was rebuffed.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-28)[\[33\]](#cite_note-33) South Korea prefers to place blame on North Korean organizations rather than the government, believing that this change in rhetoric can mollify North Korea and be conducive to a resumption of the [six-party talks](/wiki/Six-party_talks "Six-party talks").[\[28\]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-28)

Several North Korean diplomats have been arrested on suspicion of passing the counterfeit bills, but have used [diplomatic immunity](/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity "Diplomatic immunity") to evade charges.[\[34\]](#cite_note-34)

On February 2, 2006, banks in [Japan](/wiki/Japan "Japan") voluntarily enforced sanctions on Banco Delta Asia identical to those imposed by the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Chosunilbo-28) Later in August 2006, the *[Sankei Shimbun](/wiki/Sankei_Shimbun "Sankei Shimbun")* reported that North Korea had opened 23 bank accounts in 10 countries, with the likely intent of laundering more superbills.\[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

The U.S. Secret Service estimates that North Korea has produced \$45 million in superdollars since 1989. They allege that the bills are produced at the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory, which is under the supervision of General [O Kuk-ryol](/wiki/O_Kuk-ryol "O Kuk-ryol").[\[35\]](#cite_note-WashTimes-35)

In 2008 a [McClatchy Newspapers](/wiki/McClatchy_Newspapers "McClatchy Newspapers"){.mw-redirect} article reported that the United States no longer explicitly accused the North Korean government of producing supernotes, and that the [Swiss Bundeskriminalpolizei](/wiki/Federal_Office_of_Police "Federal Office of Police"), who regularly search for counterfeit currency, doubted that North Korea produced supernotes.[\[18\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-18) However, in 2009 a report by the [Congressional Research Service](/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service "Congressional Research Service") renewed the accusation.[\[5\]](#cite_note-CRS-5)

Before the [1979 Iranian Revolution](/wiki/1979_Iranian_Revolution "1979 Iranian Revolution"){.mw-redirect} Iran used [intaglio](/wiki/Intaglio_(printmaking) "Intaglio (printmaking)") machines to print its currency, as did the United States and other governments. There has been some speculation that Iran has used these to print superdollars.[\[18\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-18)[\[36\]](#cite_note-nyt-19960227-36)

CIA

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: CIA")

\]

The [CIA](/wiki/CIA "CIA"){.mw-redirect} has been accused of printing and using the counterfeit notes to fund off-the-books foreign operations.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37) Doubt concerning the nature of these supernotes arose on January 10, 2008, in the [McClatchy Washington Bureau](/wiki/McClatchy_Newspapers "McClatchy Newspapers"){.mw-redirect}. The article makes mention of the increasing doubt of testimonies and sources, and of the CIA\'s involvement. Klaus Bender, an author of works on counterfeiting, claimed that the notes are of such high quality that they could only be produced by a government agency such as the CIA.[\[18\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-18)

### 

Other

\[

[edit](/w/index.php?title=Superdollar&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Other")

Other theories of the bills\' origin have become increasingly popular; Iran remains a suspect to many, while others blame independent criminal gangs operating out of Russia or China.[\[18\]](#cite_note-mcclatchy-18) In 2000, the [Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies](/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Strategic_and_Political_Studies "Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies"), an Israel-based think tank, laid the blame on [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria"): \"The [Bekaa Valley](/wiki/Bekaa_Valley "Bekaa Valley"){.mw-redirect} has become one of the main distribution sources, if not production points, of the \'supernote\' -- counterfeit U.S. currency so well done that it is impossible to detect.\"[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)
