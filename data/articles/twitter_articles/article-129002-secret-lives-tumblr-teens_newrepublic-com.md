At Tumblr headquarters, I found myself in a contest of name-dropping teenagers' URLs, much the same way people dropped indie rock bands in college. Danielle Strle told me about [Cornputer](http://cornputer.tumblr.com/); I had to tell her that Heckacute had gone password-protected. "Oh my God, you know Pizza?" Strle said. "Yes. Oh my God, I love Pizza," I said, "Tell me about Pizza." Strle leaned in: "She's kind of controversial."

I had been trying to interview Pizza for a year before her blog disappeared in August 2014. It took almost two years to get her to talk to me. Based on a few posts about blogger meet-ups, I knew she was Australian, but nothing had been written about her in the Australian media. I sent her "fan mail" on Tumblr, the only option at the time, but popular blogs got tons of such messages, and I got no response. I sent her a direct message on Twitter, to which she responded with interest, giving me her email, but after an exchange, she went silent. I asked Tumblr to try contacting Pizza for me. No response. I tried contacting other kids on Tumblr instead, but they didn't respond to me either. Tumblr's public relations team reached out to them for me, too, but no response. I started to lose hope. And then, in August 2015, Jason Wong gave me a new email for Pizza. ("She was like a god in people's eyes," he said.) She replied, "Thank you so much for contacting me and for being interested with my blog!" and agreed to talk.

Jess Miller is a 18-year-old recent high school graduate who lives in Melbourne, Australia. Her colleagues and admirers call her Jess, but I can't help but think of her as Pizza. Almost her entire teenage life has been lived on Tumblr, and over the past five years, her fame spread offline. "I didn't really think I was 'popular' because the number of followers was there but it didn't really hit me how big the audience I had was until people recognized me in public," she said. "One day I was in the library and some girls walked into the room I was in, yelled out 'Hey Pizza,' and then ran away."

Lilley would eventually recruit a few hundred kids whose combined Tumblrs would total an estimated 35 million follows.

Miller's mom, Jodie Arrowsmith, didn't know she was on Tumblr for the first few years. "She actually didn't tell any of her friends at school," Arrowsmith said. "It was her own special thing. Her Tumblr was her little secret place where she could go and blog and say what she wanted." But people started finding out. Arrowsmith is a realtor, and once, while showing a family a house, she mentioned her kids sat at home on the internet all day. The clients' daughter was about 13, and said she had a Tumblr. "I told her my daughter was Pizza," Arrowsmith said, "and the girl almost started crying."\

In early 2014, when she was 16, some Tumblr users dug up posts Miller had written when she was 13 in which she used the word "nigga." Screenshots of [the old posts](http://tsarbucks.tumblr.com/post/72150571279/pizza-awfullydistracted-pizza) went viral. At one point, according to Miller, she had 9,500 concurrent visitors on her blog and she received over 2,000 angry messages, some of them telling her to kill herself. When I asked Miller about the posts, she sent me a long apologetic message:

> i now completely understand how horrible and ignorant they were and take full responsibility for them. theres obviously no excuse for me using that word, and despite the fact that it would be difficult for a 13 year old australian to understand american racial politics, everyone, including me, knows that it is not appropriate and i'm so frustrated and disgusted at my 13 year old self for thinking that it was acceptable, especially now after I have taken history and we had a whole semester on civil rights and slavery in america and to have a better understanding of the racial issues which were and are still present in america make me even more ashamed of my actions

 There are still (false) rumors floating around that Pizza was terminated by Tumblr [for being racist](http://sataniswhite.tumblr.com/post/72156401910/what-did-pizza-even-do). It's clear the episode affected Miller deeply. An anonymous user left a message on her new blog, Jess Cats. "Are you former tumblr user pizza?" She replied, "Yep formerly tumblr user pizza and currently a piece of trash xx." 

In November 2012, Lilley and Greenfield were contacted by Dennis Hegstad. Then 23, Hegstad had built an audience on MySpace by posting selfies; thin and sleek and handsome, with long, straight, light-brown ombré hair, [he resembles a human Afghan hound](https://www.instagram.com/dennishegstad/). He had built his online brand though his looks and taste, later producing a popular T-shirt that said, "Blow kisses not coke." He had connections in the music industry, and in October 2013 he would create Songsly, a platform where musicians could pay viral video creators to use their songs.

When he reached out to So-Relatable, Hegstad had a big Twitter audience, millions of followers across a dozen accounts. He had figured out how to monetize it, but he wanted to get into Tumblr. So-Relatable was trying to build its Twitter presence, so they agreed to exchange promotional posts with Hegstad.

Tumblr teens need to be sophisticated about making money, and they have clever tactics to increase traffic and followers and revenue, often helping each other to game Google AdSense. Why game AdSense? Tumblr users are allowed to put banner ads on their sites, but most users access Tumblr through the dashboard feed, where only Tumblr's sponsored posts can go. So that means most eyes, and the most dedicated fans, rarely if ever see those banner ads.

Tumblr has always had a complicated relationship with money. In 2010, its founder, David Karp, said, "[We're pretty opposed to advertising. It really turns our stomachs.](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/04/tumblr-ads.html)" Then in 2011: "[Making money off of Tumblr would be incredibly easy](http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/22/founder-stories-karp-tumblr-making-money/)"---he'd throw up an AdSense ad on every user's dashboard and make the site "wildly profitable." In April 2012 sponsored content began appearing in users' streams. Tumblr was, at that time, still a unicorn; the possibility of making money was just as powerful an asset as the actual making of it. In 2013, [Yahoo bought Tumblr for \$1 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/20/technology/yahoo-buys-tumblr/) and began a new ad rollout, but after a year, Karp's wild profitability still hadn't materialized. A former Tumblr executive told *The New York Times* that Tumblr's anonymity was a hurdle: "Real-world identities are valuable to advertisers. [Tumblr doesn't have that](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/technology/no-regrets-for-the-founder-of-tumblr-after-yahoo-sale.html?_r=0)."

In a sense, Yahoo faces the same problem as Tumblr users: There isn't a lot of money in banner ads. Yahoo is experiencing declining revenue in display ads and the company is trying to make up for it with native advertising---ads that look like human-created content but were actually made for brands. Likewise, some Tumblr users have tried their own kind of native ads---posts endorsing products that link to the stores where you can buy them. Tumblr does not like this. It considers these posts "spam," and will terminate an account for posting  too many affiliate advertising links, or anything the company deems "non-genuine social gestures."

With AdSense banners, users get paid when a reader clicks or views an ad. However, Google forbids "click fraud"---you can't just click on an ad on your own blog all day and watch the money come in. Google has bots looking for that. So teens have schemes to evade the bots. There are a handful of secret Facebook groups and multi-member chats for Tumblr users with high follower counts---between 10,000 and 100,000 or even more---with names like Wallflowers 2.0 and GOATS. There they organize to trade favors, like agreeing to   promote each other's posts. An "r4r" in the Facebook group is offering an exchange of reblogs, so each blog is exposed to a wider set of followers. An "r4c" means a user will reblog a post for someone who promises to visit their blog, refresh it several times, click on the ad, and then refresh *it* several times---but only if you're from a "premium country," because Google pays more for clicks from Ireland, for example, than from the Philippines. An ad might specify "please no car/dating/clothing web sites!" because those ads pay less per click. The blog must be refreshed until a better-paying ad shows up, like one from a bank.

Lilley and Greenfield felt the sting of a bad exchange a few times, but the biggest lesson came with Lifehackable. Though they'd exploited Tom's failures, he got the better of them in the end. Lilley and Greenfield had agreed to split ad revenue 50-50 with Tom, but a few months later, they noticed the ads on the site had been replaced with images promoting Tom's YouTube channel [JusstTom](https://www.youtube.com/user/jussttom). "As if we'd never notice that all the ads changed to be about Tom and put his face on them," Greenfield said. Now Lifehackable.com---which once made \$1,963 in a single day---redirects to the YouTube channel.

Though Tom is handsome, he lacks an easy charisma and JusstTom is not very popular. His videos are about dating advice, and together we watched him explain what to do when a guy won't text you back. "He would have been so much better off if he didn't screw us over," Lilley said. Greenfield added, "He had a great revenue source and just threw it in the trash." Lilley was disgusted by the thought of "trying to build a personal brand by sacrificing your content." The two had chosen to build their empire by not focusing on their own personalities.

"Tumblr's different because no one really cares what you look like, they only care about what you post," Jess Miller told me. Its stars often have as far to climb, at least socioeconomically, as their fans. Wong's mom couldn't pay his college tuition, so he's using Tumblr to pay for it himself. He also pays some of his mom's bills. When I asked him if his mom approved of his Tumblr career, Wong said he tells her, "'Why is our bank account not in the negative anymore? Why do I have money to go to college?' It's better not to argue but to just show results."

That fall, Hegstad gave Lilley and Greenfield some valuable tips: The end of the year is the most profitable time for banner ads, and he taught them how to tweak the layout of their site and the display of their banner ads. Fairly subtle stuff, but they made thousands more dollars the next month. "He did a lot of things that helped us, and he was never getting a piece of it," Lilley said.

At first, Lilley and Greenfield just wanted to make enough money to pay their way to the annual YouTube-sponsored conference, VidCon, in Los Angeles, but their vision expanded as So Relatable Inc. took off. In January 2013, they quit college. According to their bank records, in March 2013, Google paid them \$25,350.45. It was lot of money for internet jokes, a lot of money for two 18-year-olds from Reading, Pennsylvania. Lilley had wanted to get out of his hometown for years and proposed moving in with Hegstad in L.A.

I was skeptical about these numbers, so I asked Lilley and Greenfield to drive me to their bank and print out their records. The teller knew them, and asked if they missed Los Angeles. They said it never rained. They later told me she always asks them that, even though they'd been home for months. I also asked them to show me three years of tax returns. They did that too. The unpredictable waves of virality made the Google payments go up and down based on how many people visited their site---\$9,113.04 in May 2013, \$18,805.09 in June.

It took a few months, but Lilley and Greenfield decided to move to the West Coast. Lilley made of all of the arrangements with Hegstad, who agreed to be their roommate. Greenfield later admitted, "I actually didn't meet him or ever have a single conversation with him online until the day before we signed the lease."

In the summer of 2013, Lilley and Greenfield moved into a historic bank building converted into lofts with original art deco details in downtown Los Angeles; scenes from *[The Dark Knight Rises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAjEW2zgs_o)* and *[Spiderman 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1s-PVl3k5c)* had been filmed in the lobby. When he first saw the apartment, Lilley thought he'd finally made it. "It felt like something we could call ours, something we could show for everything we do, which is just on a screen."

The loft was multilevel, with stairs next to the living room going up to the bedrooms above. Hegstad had the room at the top of the stairs, "like he was king of the jungle." Lilley decorated his room with a wall decal of Notorious B.I.G.'s head and a Tupac Shakur lyric: "You know my momma used to tell me / if you can't find something to live for / then you [best find something to die for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l46NwNB8oQI)." Lilley and Hegstad both loved rap, and they played it all day long, so loud it echoed through the walls. "They were like my little brother's age," Hegstad later told me. "They were cool. Semi-introverted, but fun."

At 19, neither Lilley nor Greenfield were old enough to drink; they couldn't enjoy the free beer on tap at the WeWork office they rented, much less get into clubs. Instead they spent their off-hours playing video games and ordering Chinese food. There were parties at the loft, on the rooftop, but the guest list was selective---either people they worked with or could possibly work with, because Hegstad, Greenfield recalled, didn't "associate with the plebes." Lilley discovered Hegstad had a talent for networking, a lot of people did in L.A. There were friendly people in the city, for sure, but when Lilley met other people in his business, like the people at the roof parties, they always seemed to want something. One guest was a British YouTube star who Lilley and Greenfield found repellent.

> **Greenfield**: He was like, "Wow, this is such a great view. I want to come and fuck a girl up here. I want to set up a screen."
>
> **Lilley**: He was like, "I'd smash every night on this roof."
>
> **Greenfield**: And then someone was like, "But all those neighbors can see you." Because if you're on our roof, there's at any given time hundreds of people that can see you. And he's like, "I don't care. I'd set up a screen and broadcast it."
>
> **Lilley**: And not to mention the police in their helicopters. That's a crime. Exposure.

 So-Relatable and its associated blogs had a good summer, and in September they made \$24,296.26 with Google AdSense. With traffic on the rise, Hegstad suggested they move to DoubleClick, Google's premium ad network, and the move made October their biggest monthly payout to date: \$54,269.33. Lilley and Greenfield's tax returns showed they made \$249,000 that year. The three of them started to think about building a company that would connect brands to Tumblr blogs and cut out the middleman---or better yet, *become* the middleman and take a cut. ("Everyone who's been a publisher has had that thought," said Lilley.) It would be a platform on which social media accounts could find advertising campaigns to post on their site, and they would charge a portion of the revenue for the convenience. They'd call the company Exposely.

But at the end of 2013, disaster: AdSense banned Lilley and Greenfield just as they were due a large check---Greenfield estimated it was \$50,000. Months later, an anonymous person claiming to be a Google employee would post [a supposed tell-all](http://pastebin.com/qh6Tta3h) on Pastebin, a text-sharing site used primarily by coders, claiming that AdSense intentionally bans people just before big checks are due. (Many tech blogs suspect the confession is a fake.) A class action lawsuit was filed against Google in 2014, and Business Insider noted, "[Google often behaves so mysteriously](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-adsense-leak-fake-conspiracy-theory-2014-5#ixzz31dKpfs8M) that many advertisers and publishers will actually welcome the suit: It may finally shed some light on exactly how and why Google kicks web sites out of its vast, \$60 billion-a-year advertising system." The class action case was dismissed in early 2015, as was a similar suit, in which Google [canceled a site's account when it allegedly owed \$535,000](http://www.businessinsider.com/super-cray-sues-google-for-500k-2015-1), then later reinstated it, but didn't pay the money. "It was a huge wake-up call," Lilley said. "It felt like working somewhere, putting in a lot of work, and you show up one day and they throw all your shit in a box and they're like 'get the fuck out' and they won't even say why you were fired."

Still, they continued with Exposely, sometimes working 60 hours a week. The pair hardly ventured outside the loft. Hegstad hired a developer, Greenfield worked on support, while Lilley recruited bloggers from Tumblr, focusing on users with the biggest accounts. Through So-Relatable they'd met many users with high follower counts---the same kids who were trading promotional links in the Facebook groups. Lilley would eventually recruit a few hundred kids, mostly teen humor blogs, whose combined Tumblrs would total an estimated 35 million followers. His recruits included the biggest teen comedy blog of all: Pizza.

Jess Miller was 16 in the spring of 2014. She had just weathered the racism controversy and now had more than half a million followers. David Karp had been following her for a year. Her boyfriend started a Tumblr with the user name Moistbottom, and while they didn't really write about their relationship, they were the subject of intense fan interest. (When an anonymous user asked Moistbottom, "how far have you and Jess gone?" he responded, "[TO THE BEACH](http://ledgendairy.tumblr.com/post/92918467339/how-far-have-you-and-jess-gone).")

Lilley and Greenfield were unabashed fans of Miller; they respected her social strategy and were quick to recall her best posts. Lilley sent her a Facebook message the day he arrived on the West Coast*:* "i'm in LA!" Even before Exposely, they'd had a business relationship: Lilley and Greenfield paid her \$10 to reblog three posts to her huge audience. Miller was "very fair with her prices," Lilley said. "It was like buying popularity, but it was real." When Miller had started making money off of her Tumblr, her mother had to create the PayPal account for her because she was under 18, but the bank account was solely Miller's. Her mother told me at her peak her daughter was making \$2,800 to \$8,400 a week in U.S. dollars---more than she herself earned as a Melbourne-area real estate agent.

In Facebook messages, Lilley congratulated Miller on reaching new milestones. When she hit 800,000 followers, he wrote, "i'm just waiting for you to hit a million, not if but when. just keep doing your thing you obvi don't need me to say that to you I just am sometimes blown away like woah so yeah." Miller was always gracious: "thank you!! hahaha i rly hope i get 1 mill cos that'd be crazy wow." In April 2014, Lilley messaged Miller about a new way to make money: "I'm signing up people, would love for you to be one of our first publishers on exposely!"

Exposely had a major selling point for kids in a similar position to So-Relatable: Its Google AdSense account would be a way for teens who'd been banned to still make money from ads. Exposely offered its publishers both pay per click and pay per conversion. The pay-per-click scheme worked like this: Exposely set up three garbage content sites with mindless slide shows---[14 Celebrities That Look Like Mattresse](http://sobadsogood.com/2012/03/29/14-celebrities-that-look-like-mattresses/)s---called Trending.ly, Styles.ly, and Eats.ly. There were ads on each page of the slide show, and the kids would post a couple slides from the site on their Tumblrs, with the right headline and text along the lines of *omg this is so funny*. The ads tracked which Tumblr sent the traffic, and the teens were paid 75 percent of the ad revenue for each click.

The pay-per-conversion program could make more money, but it cost its users something else entirely. Hegstad got an account at a health affiliate network---a snake-oil sales depot. The idea was to create an advertisement mimicking a Tumblr post, and the ad would include a link to a diet pill site. If a person clicked on the ad, went to the site, and bought a bottle of pills containing synthetic raspberry ketone, the Tumblr user who reblogged the ad would get \$18---after Exposely took a \$20 cut.

Raspberry ketone is a compound that gives raspberries their distinctive smell and taste. In its natural form it is very expensive, and is often used by the perfume industry. Synthetic raspberry ketone, however, is cheaper to produce, and [when Dr. Oz hailed the substance as a miracle fat-burner](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Diet/raspberry-ketones-frenzy/story?id=16074044) in 2012, he began a raspberry ketone media frenzy. One study indicated mice fed a super high dosage while on a high-fat diet [did not gain as much fat in the liver,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15862604) but there's no evidence it makes humans thin. In 2013, a 24-year-old woman [fatally overdosed on a version made by Forza](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2866843/Woman-died-taking-overdose-raspberry-ketone-slimming-pills.html)---the pills also have a ton of caffeine.

Hegstad figured out a way to make a landing page for the diet pills by looking at what his competitors did. ("I would hate to say clone and modify," he said, "but that's kind of a good place to start.") It resulted in a huge conversion rate---as high as 10 percent---by featuring before-and-after photos claiming people had lost weight with the pills, and a video of Dr. Oz claiming they burn fat. (The celebrity doctor [was berated at a 2014 Senate hearing](http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/17/health/senate-grills-dr-oz/) for misleading his audience about the efficacy of "miracle" weight-loss supplements.)

 "The whole point of the video was to reinforce that this is a real thing, this has been on television even," Lilley said. "It was just crazy how much it worked," he said, not of the pills, but of the landing page.

So in between Tumblr posts about life's daily tragedies, like someone stepping on the back of your shoe, there appeared these diet pill posts. A Tumblr user explained to me that So-Relatable had an advantage by posting these ads, because their blog had a theme of relatable quotes and life hacks. The fit was natural. "Life Hack: You can lose 20 pounds per month with this magic pill."

![](//images.newrepublic.com/c0eafac9b8fecfd484763e50f521ba120cf47ac0.png?w=800){width="800"}

Lilley wrote the diet pill ads, and as with all his work on Tumblr, he did it very well. He began by reading up on David Ogilvy, "the [father of advertising](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/business/david-ogilvy-88-father-of-soft-sell-in-advertising-dies.html?pagewanted=all)," and he learned the best ad is often the one that doesn't seem like an ad. "The idea was to make an ad that looks like word of mouth from a fellow user," he said. It's easy to ignore a TV spot by a stranger, "but if it's presented to you in a way that she's your peer, she's a similar person to you, you don't even know her in the same way, but it feels different. It's like it seems more genuine." You know, more relatable.

"Hi I'm Brittany and this is my weight loss story!" Lilley crafted his testimonials from a girl's perspective, honing the copy, making sure the line breaks were just right. The posts showed the familiar diptych of a woman looking self-conscious and curvy on the left and happy and thin on the right, and underneath, a testimony about pounds melting off without pain and suffering.

"'My best friend recommended it' was one of my more major contributions," Lilley said. He read from the post: "'I lost 24 pounds in four weeks with minor exercise and no change in diet. Here's how I did it: with this organic supplement'---that doesn't sound good." But " 'Here's how I did it: with this organic supplement *my best friend recommended*'---just seemed to me more real-sounding and ... just makes it seem like in the back of someone's mind they could think, well, my best friend could have recommended this to me."

Exposely's diet pill scheme got going in April 2014, and it worked---it worked like crazy. Trending.ly got almost 7 million views that month, and with the diet pill ads, they sometimes achieved a conversion rate near 10 percent. Once, across all their blogs, Exposely made \$24,000 in a single day.

The Tumblr teens loved it. Lilley showed me messages asking when they'd get their money---pay-for-click was monthly, pay-for-conversion was weekly---often doing the math to make sure they were paid for all conversions. One kid messaged Lilley, "i'm so proud of you and all your hard work." Lilley had to explain to Miller she had to fill out a tax form---"we need to have everyone fill one out like to run our business legitimately and stuff." But he had good news: "check your balance tho :)" She replied, "YOURE THE BEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD TJANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU :))))))"

Then in June 2014, Pizza reached an unheard of milestone for a Tumblr teen: "pizza hit 1 million followers today. I am small and weak," one Tumblr user wrote. "everyone buy pizza today to celebrate jess pizza hitting 1 million followers!" another said. "HEY BIG CONGRATS!! I KNEW YOU'D DO IT J OMG A MILLION HOW'S IT FEEL," Lilley told her. Miller replied: "THANKS!! AND IT FEELS SO GOOD LIKE WOW 1 MILLION PEOPLE?!?! J" Lilley wrote back, "YEAH THATS AMAZING ... HERES TO THE NEXT MILLION ... YOU DESERVE IT ALL ... Btw wanna get another reblog deal going?"

That same month, Lilley wrote another Tumblr user, "in a few months I bet we'll be doing milli's. We got our biggest check ever from Adsense coming for Exposely, 160k coming. That's for everyone that posted rev-share including us but still." For Lilley, the "milli's" didn't come. In July 2014, Exposely was banned from AdSense too.

It was the next month that it happened. On August 19, just days before his twentieth birthday, Lilley tried to log in to So-Relatable but couldn't. Greenfield checked the site, which redirected to an error page: "There's nothing here. Whatever you were looking for doesn't currently exist at this address." They'd been terminated, their blogs revoked by Tumblr for violating its terms of service.
