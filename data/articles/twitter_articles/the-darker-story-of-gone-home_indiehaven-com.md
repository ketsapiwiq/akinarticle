**Content warning: This article discusses a fictitious incident of child abuse.**

It's been a few years since the release of *Gone Home*, and the first person narrative from The Fullbright Company remains an important video game. It confidently asserted that games have the potential to tell alternative stories. Recently released on current gen consoles, the neo-classic is still as captivating as it was upon release.

*Gone Home* tells the story of Sam, a disaffected teenager who's been uprooted from her home and moved to Arbour Hill, Portland. She meets Lonnie and is immediately drawn to her. Sam is enamoured with Lonnie's world of post-punk teenage rebellion, and their connection deepens quickly. Together they battle against Sam's concerned parents and other authority figures to stay together -- it's them versus the world. Sam soon realises that her feelings for Lonnie are deeper than friendship -- she's in love. Despite veering towards fantasy in its final act, it's an endearing tale where young love can conquer all, and it serves as an honest and relatable depiction of what it was like growing up queer in the nineties.

Because of that, the game drew an adverse reaction from those who saw it as a slight against traditional video games. Some felt they were mislead into playing *Gone Home* by the promise of a horror game, only to find a coming-of-age queer love story in its place. While the unnerving setting of a deserted family home on a stormy night provided moments of tension, it isn't a horror story. But it is a game that quietly tells a story of horror.

When I talk to people about *Gone Home*, I mostly find that a darker narrative went unnoticed, even by those who cherish the game. That's understandable, because it's told with such subtlety that it never becomes the focus. Even after all of the disparate parts are discovered, it isn't immediately clear. I didn't fully realise the underlying themes myself until I read this incredibly insightful post from [ClockworkWorlds](http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better). Then it was abundantly clear.

It's heavy subject matter is worthy of discussion not only because of the issues it presents, but because it adds another layer of depth to an already rich experience, and shows how Fullbright managed to weave a dynamic story without ever being explicit in its telling.

It's the story of Terry Greenbriar, Sam and Katie's father. Terry is a writer; a science fiction novelist who's had two books published. The first sold poorly, the second even worse. Terry's publisher rejected his pitch for a third instalment and parted ways with him. To keep a regular paycheck, he took a mundane job reviewing home stereo systems for a tech magazine. Unsettled and professionally dissatisfied, he began to drink. His state of mind became evident in his work as he turned in incoherent essays about his childhood rather than the latest laser disc player, resulting in a stern, final warning from his editor. His marriage to Janice was disintegrating. Terry had become withdrawn, and Janice, desperate for intimacy, entered into a flirtatious relationship with a co-worker.

Terry's office had a board filled with ideas for his next book. Different angles are considered, but they all hinge upon one concept -- his protagonist, John Russell, must go back in time to stop the assassination of president Kennedy, an incident that occurred a few days before Thanksgiving in 1963. A centerpiece for the idea is a reminder: YOU CAN DO BETTER. These are the words of his father. In a letter to Terry following the publication of his first novel, his cursory congratulation precedes a cold critique of Terry's work. He acknowledges that Terry uses writing to work through his problems, but finds the allegorical fiction derivative. He farewells his son with that most backhanded compliment.

Terry is creatively and emotionally stifled, that much is clear, but there's more to this story than that of a washed up author.

Oscar Masan, Terry's uncle, lived in the Arbor Hill mansion and owned the local pharmacy. He died a recluse before the events of the game. Oscar's will and last testament is found in Terry's office, locked in the top drawer of a filing cabinet. Oscar left everything to Terry, including the house. Why is a document regarding an inheritance worthy of locking away? The answer is found in the basement.

In a corridor of the basement is a safe, and a room storing timber at its end. There are markings of Terry's childhood height on the wall. The first was taken when Terry was six, the last when he was twelve, on Thanksgiving, 1963.

[![232430\_2016-01-14\_00030](http://indiehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/232430_2016-01-14_00030-1024x576.png){.alignnone .size-large .wp-image-20591 width="750" height="422"}](http://indiehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/232430_2016-01-14_00030.png)

The safe opens when that date is entered. 1-9-6-3. Inside, buried among syringes and morphine, is a letter from Oscar to his sister, Terry's mother. The letter speaks of a transgression, and of Oscar's decision to sell his pharmacy to avoid temptation. He expresses self hatred and begs for forgiveness, knowing he won't receive it. The letter has been returned to the sender. What was the transgression? The drug paraphernalia suggests addiction, but the transgression he speaks of deserves no forgiveness.

In the dank cell that houses timber, the light doesn't work. There, the most unsettling item is found amongst firewood. A wooden horse, a child's toy. Its placement anywhere else would be benign, but here in the darkness it screams. The sad truth becomes evident.

Oscar was a child abuser, and Terry was the victim.

Terry is consumed by the year 1963. His book's protagonist travels back to that time to prevent a tragedy. The Kennedy assassination occurred just days before Terry was coerced into the basement on Thanksgiving Day. It became the analogue for the abuse. Terry's mother found out on that day and the torment ceased, but the repercussions hadn't yet begun to take hold.

The hiding of Oscar's will reflected the shame he felt about living in a home inherited from the predator, and for bringing his family there. He used alcohol to dull the pain. The frustrated introspections that infiltrated his reviews were cries for help. He's unable to confide in Janice, so he pulls away from her. His father never knew how to address the abuse of his son, so he kept him at a distance to avoid confronting his feelings of failure. The toy was still in the dank cellar.

 

Terry's struggles are cast in a new light, and it's heartbreaking, but *Gone Home* doesn't dwell on the abuse itself, so neither will I. What could have manifested as a sad statement on the powerlessness of abuse victims instead becomes a story of Terry's transition from victim to survivor.

Oscar was a monster. Terry didn't become one. Without suggesting whatsoever that victims become perpetrators, the so called "cycle of abuse" did not continue. There's no stigma surrounding Terry's parenting, he's a loving father. He isn't perfect; he struggles with Sam's rebellion and her sexuality, but he tries to understand her. He buys her lame self-help books about how to make friends. He even allows Lonnie to continue visiting the family's home after suspecting their intimate relationship, provided Sam keeps her door open. By 1995 parenting standards, that's fucking revolutionary. Katie adores him. In the many postcards she sent home while on sabbatical, she often mentions places or events her father would enjoy. Despite their strained marriage, Janice shows unwavering support. Scrawled on an abandoned draft is a note from Janice, urging him not to give up. She knows he can do better, but unlike Terry's father, she expresses her belief in him and his ability.

Jan and Terry's absence in the game is veiled as an anniversary getaway, but the two are actually at Strong Pines -- a couples' counseling retreat. Together they set out to mend the rift between them, a rift that grew from Terry's silence about the abuse. I like to believe he broke that silence on the retreat and finally began to heal, with Janice by his side.

Terry received a letter from Unknown Dimensions -- a publishing house that specialises in obscure cult-fiction. They sought to reprint his books and market them directly to their audience. The new, vividly illustrated editions of Terry's novels are found in plain sight, not shamefully boxed up like the first print. The renewed interest in his series revives his creative passion, and he pitches a new instalment to his publisher. His letter is filled with a sense of purpose; he sounds alive. And this time, he has a new angle.

[![232430\_2016-01-15\_00006](http://indiehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/232430_2016-01-15_00006-1024x576.png){.alignnone .size-large .wp-image-20590 width="750" height="422"}](http://indiehaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/232430_2016-01-15_00006.png)

Terry is no longer a victim. He knows what he must do to move on. He's still using fiction to deal with his trauma, but is no longer obsessed with a tragedy that already happened, no longer consumed by the year 1963 or the president. His writing will explore what he's able to influence now, and it ceases to be defined by the things that happened to him.

This is where Terry's story ends, and begins. We don't know what happened from here. We don't know if his manuscript was accepted and lead to a successful novel. We don't know if his efforts to save his marriage worked. But the results aren't important. What matters is that Terry was ready overcome the transgression. He stopped living in the shadows of a dank basement and a dead tormentor. Aided by the love and support of his family, he changed the trajectory of his life.

Of course it's not that simple. Terry faced a formidable journey, but his story is one of resilience, and I hope it uplifted those who've been affected by abuse. The story is a credit to The Fullbright Company, who showed endless empathy and sensitivity while bravely engaging with a subject that few games have.

Gone Home is not only about the stories found in drawers and cupboards, but the stories we keep locked in that most impenetrable fortress -- ourselves. Some stories are of the impossibly perfect romances of youth. Others are not. But all of Gone Home's stories tell us that even in the darkest corners of the family home, love and salvation can be found there.
