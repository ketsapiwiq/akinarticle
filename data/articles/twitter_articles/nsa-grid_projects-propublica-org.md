This is a plot of the NSA programs revealed in the past year according to whether they are bulk or targeted, and whether the targets of surveillance are foreign or domestic. Most of the programs fall squarely into the agencyâ€™s stated mission of foreign surveillance, but some â€" particularly those that are both domestic and broad-sweeping â€" are more controversial.

Just as with the New York Magazine [approval matrix](http://nymag.com/nymag/culture/approvalmatrix/archive/) that served as our inspiration, the placement of each program is based on judgments and is approximate.
