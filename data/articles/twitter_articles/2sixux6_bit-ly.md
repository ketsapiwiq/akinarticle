Thursday 8 June

An inundation of last-minute opinion polls agree on one thing: a Tory lead on vote share. At the squeaky end of the range is [Survation](https://twitter.com/Survation/status/872586205006888961), pegging the Conservatives on 41.3% and Labour on 40.4%. A good hollering distance away are [ICM](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/07/tories-on-12-point-lead-over-labour-in-final-pre-election-poll), which predicts a 12-point Tory lead (46% to 34%), and [BMG](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15334427.Britain_at_crossroads_as_eve_of_poll_survey_suggests_May_heading_for_landslide_victory/), which makes it 13 (46% v 33%).

The inbetweeners are [Kantar TNS](http://uk.kantar.com/ge2017/2017/conservatives-heading-for-election-win/) (five points), [YouGov](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/d8zsb99eyd/TimesResults_FINAL%20CALL_GB_June2017_W.pdf) and [Opinium](http://opinium.co.uk/political-polling-4th-june-2017/) (both seven), [Panelbase](http://www.panelbase.com/media/polls/W10470w7tablesforpublication.pdf) (eight) and [ComRes](http://www.comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Independent_FINAL-VI-and-Political-Poll_7th-June-2017_130392.pdf) (10). All Tory leads, in case you were wondering. And all have the Lib Dems doodling on between 7% and 10%.

On Scottish Westminster voting intention, [BMG for the Herald](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15331894.Ex_BBC_star_would_lose_seat__poll_analysis_suggests/) pins it at the SNP on 42%, Conservatives on 27% and Labour on 21%. [Survation](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/872595284886507521) mixes it up a bit with the SNP on 39%, Labour leapfrogging to 29% and the Tories on 26%.
