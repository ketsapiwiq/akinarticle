Twitter account on Friday afternoon caused the stock of a pharmaceutical company to crash, costing the company millions of dollars.

Sanders told his 2.6 million followers that Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. had raised the price of its leukemia drug "to almost \$199,000 a year."

"Drug corporations' greed is unbelievable," [the Vermont senator tweeted](https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/786969683698286596).

Shortly after the tweet, Ariad's stock lost 15 percent of its value --- or \$387 million dollars --- its biggest intraday decline in over a year, [according to Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-14/sanders-tweet-on-drugmaker-ariad-s-greed-sends-stock-plunging).

The drug mentioned in Sanders tweet, Iclusig, helps to treat a rare form of leukemia, and has indeed seen its price raised four times this year alone, to \$16,000 for a 30-day pack.
