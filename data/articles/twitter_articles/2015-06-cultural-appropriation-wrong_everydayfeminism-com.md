So, you just walked into a Halloween party. You think you're wearing a kick-ass costume, but instead of giving you a compliment, someone tells you that your costume [counts as cultural appropriation](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/culture-is-not-a-costume/).

And you think that's a ridiculous accusation. *You?* Doing something *racist?*

You didn't have hateful intentions, so you don't know how you could have [a negative impact](http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/07/intentions-dont-really-matter/). Plus, nobody likes being told that they "can't" do something, and you feel like this person's saying you can't wear your costume -- even if you don't mean to hurt anyone.

**So if you're wondering what the big deal is about cultural appropriation, I've got you covered.**

Read on for some perspective on why people might get upset if you borrow from another culture.

 {#section .p4}

**What Cultural Appropriation Is (And Isn't)**

**In short: Cultural appropriation is when somebody adopts aspects of a culture that's not their own.**

But that's only the most basic definition.

A deeper understanding of cultural appropriation also refers to a particular ***power dynamic* in which** **members of a dominant culture take elements from a culture of people who have been systematically oppressed *by that dominant group*.**

That's why cultural appropriation is [not the same as cultural exchange](http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/09/cultural-exchange-and-cultural-appropriation/), when people share mutually with each other -- because cultural exchange lacks that systemic power dynamic.

It's also [not the same as assimilation](http://www.refinery29.com/ralph-lauren-native-appropriation), when marginalized people adopt elements of the dominant culture in order to survive conditions that make life more of a struggle if they don't.

Some say, for instance, that non-Western people who wear jeans and Indigenous people who speak English are taking from dominant cultures, too.

**But marginalized groups don't have the power to decide if they'd prefer to stick with their customs or try on the dominant culture's traditions just for fun.**

When the last living survivors of massacred Indigenous tribes are [fighting to save their language](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/24/video-last-fluent-wukchumni-speaker-fights-save-her-language-156527) before it [dies when they do](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/04/ancient-language-extinct-speaker-dies), and Native students are [suspended for speaking in their own Indigenous languages](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/02/07/student-suspended-speaking-native-american-language-96340), mirroring the [abusive US boarding schools](http://grisham.newsvine.com/_news/2012/03/05/10582624-the-horror-of-native-american-boarding-schools) that tried to wipe out Native American cultures up until the 1980s, it's clear that not every person who speaks English does so by choice.

**In other words, context matters.**

**Which means it's not about saying that you, as an individual, are a bad person if you appropriate someone else's culture.**

It's a complicated issue that includes our histories, our current state of affairs, and our future, as we act to [eliminate oppression](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/08/honor-native-americans-without-appropriating/), instead of [perpetuating](http://theskinnyjeanrant.com/2014/04/12/determining-the-effects-of-the-cultural-appropriation-of-aboriginal-traditions-in-fashion/) it.

So if you're still baffled about why people would get upset about this issue, consider the following contexts.

 {#section-1 .p4}

**1. It Trivializes Violent Historical Oppression**

To you, it can feel like a big deal to have to give up something you've borrowed from another culture and incorporated into your life, especially if it's meaningful to you in some way.

For example, owners and fans of the NFL team the Washington Redsk\*ns have largely [come to the defense](http://nativeappropriations.com/2014/09/white-tears-and-aggressive-indians-native-activists-on-the-daily-show.html#comments) of the name, [pulling out every reason](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/01/argue-against-racist-mascots/) including "honoring Indians," "keeping to tradition," and "[you're being too sensitive](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/04/too-sensitive-not-problem/)," in reaction to Indigenous activists calling for the end of Indian mascots.

The fans and the NFL are emotionally and financially invested in the name and don't want to take extra time and money to change it. And that makes sense.

But consider this: **When violence systematically targets a group of people through genocide, slavery, or colonization,** [**the resulting trauma**](http://www.sharingculture.info/what-is-historical-trauma.html) **lasts** [**through generations**](http://www.fncaringsociety.com/sites/default/files/online-journal/vol5num1/fast-collin-vezina_pp126.pdf)**.**

So here's what's at stake for the Native people: The term ["redsk\*](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/washington-football-team-108213.html#ixzz3bIA2bX3T)n" comes from the time when the colonial and state governments and companies paid white people to kill Native Americans and used their scalps or even genitalia (to prove their sex), aka "red skins," as proof of their "Indian kill."   

Given that history, is it a surprise that so [many Native people are angry](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/01/argue-against-racist-mascots/) about football fans who think they're "honoring" Native people with this mascot and their excuses? 

**We should be ashamed of this time in our history -- and we should be working to heal the damage from it.**

But instead, the NFL (and other sports teams) insist on celebrating the genocide of a people for fun and profit.

**2. It Lets People Show Love for the Culture, But Remain Prejudiced Against Its People**

White people don't ask to be born with privilege, but what they choose to do with it is another story.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, I witness people taking what they like without wanting to associate with where it came from all the time.

**Here, recent transplants to the area write Yelp reviews in search of "authentic Mexican food" without the "sketchy neighborhoods" -- which usually [happen to be what they call neighborhoods](http://mobile.pcmag.com/news/47641-new-app-that-crowdsources-sketchy-local-areas-fights-charges-of-racism?origref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) with higher numbers of people of color.**

The Yelpers are getting what they want, at least in terms of the neighborhood, [as gentrification rapidly](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/what-its-like-to-get-kicked-out-of-your-neighborhood/) pushes [people of color out of their homes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/us/high-rents-elbow-latinos-from-san-franciscos-mission-district.html), and [white-owned, foodie-friendly versions](http://uptownalmanac.com/2014/09/finally-san-francisco-has-mexican-food-white-people) of their favorite "ethnic" restaurants open up.

**That's how it goes with cultural appropriation: not sharing so there's more for everyone, but taking advantage of the power imbalance between groups to have more for well-off white people, and less and less for poor people of color.**

And this can happen because we live in a world in which racist white people can essentially say "We want your stuff, but we don't like you" by taking people's traditions while being biased against who they are as a person.

**Cultural appropriation shows that you don't have to like a person or respect their identity to feel entitled to take from them.**

So is every non-Mexican who enjoys a good burrito guilty of cultural appropriation? Say it ain't so! That would include me and nearly everyone I know.

But now that you know that popularizing ["ethnic" food can be](http://bitchmagazine.org/article/craving-the-other) one way to harm a group of people while taking from their traditions, you can think about ways to satisfy your international food cravings [without participating in that harm](http://www.renderfoodmag.com/blog/2014/9/11/breaking-bread-the-politics-of-mexican-food-in-the-us).

**3. It Makes Things 'Cool' for White People -- But 'Too Ethnic' for People of Color**

**The US is a white-dominated society, and for proof of that, search no further than the way immigrants, Indigenous people, and people of color are criticized for the things that distinguish us from white Americans.**

For example, standards of professionalism [hold back all kinds of people](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/02/professionalism-and-oppression/) who aren't white men. As a Black woman, there are many [jobs that would bar me](http://www.ebony.com/style/fighting-for-our-hair-in-corporate-america-032#axzz3b09Kz1qt) if I wore cornrows, dreadlocks, or an afro -- some of the [most natural ways to keep up my hair](http://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/rue-just-perfectly-defined-cultural-appropriation#.enWylYxlX).

So for me, wearing my hair naturally is a meaningful declaration that I believe in my natural beauty. It's risky to make this declaration in a society that says I must aspire to whiteness have value.

Compare that to fashion magazines' reception of white teenager Kylie Jenner's ["epic" cornrows](http://www.thegloss.com/2014/04/03/beauty/marie-claire-kendall-jenner-cornrows-braids-black-twitter-responses/) or ["edgy" dreadlocks](http://politic365.com/2015/02/09/why-i-have-a-problem-with-kylie-jenners-dreadlocks/).

**When Black women have to fight for acceptance with the same styles a young white woman can be admired for, what message does that send to Black women and girls?**

It says that our natural beauty isn't beautiful at all -- and that our features are only appealing when they're adopted by white women.

 {#section-4 .p4}

**4. It Lets Privileged People Profit from Oppressed People's Labor**

Supposedly, in the good ol' US of A, we're all free to pursue the capitalistic American dream of building our own wealth.

But in reality, it's not that simple.

For many people, **barriers like** [**classism**](http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate)**,** [**racism, and xenophobia**](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/01/how-you-benefit-from-racism/) **mean they don't have the right look, language, or position of privilege to earn income with their culturally specific tools** -- and yet oftentimes, white people can turn those same culturally specific tools into profit, thereby hurting the community they're borrowing from.

So, for example, say a middle-class white woman gets into Native American spirituality, and sees the chance to start a business based on what she's learned. That might seem innocent enough. She has an interest, and she wants to make money off of it. That's the dream, right?

**But the problem is that in order to sell her products, she has to participate in a discriminatory system.** This system includes [federal government policies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/03/13/5-ways-the-government-keeps-native-americans-in-poverty/) that make it hard for Native people to start their own businesses, as well as a professional culture in which [white women](http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/) and [middle class women](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/common-classist-assumptions/) can fit more easily than poor Native women.

So while she profits, the [Native women she adopted her products from live](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/13/1-in-4-native-americans-and-alaska-natives-are-living-in-poverty/) in deep [cycles of poverty](http://indianyouth.org/american-indian-life/poverty-cycle) and [unemployment](http://www.epi.org/publication/high-unemployment-means-native-americans/).

So white women dominate the industry of New Age materials with watered down versions of Indian spirituality practices, drowning out the Native voices speaking up about what Native communities need to survive.

In her fantastic essay ["For All Those Who Were Indian in a Former Life,"](http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/formlife.htm) Andrea Smith breaks down how all this plays out when white feminists claim Indian spirituality and "want to become Indian without holding themselves accountable to Indian communities."

**Someone with white privilege and class privilege has other options for earning income, so they don't have to resort to profiting from someone else's labor or culture. And the risks involved for marginalized people show that it's more ethical to pursue another path.**

**5. It Lets Some People Get Rewarded for Things the Creators Never Got Credit For**

Who comes to mind when you think of rock and roll?

Is it a white person?

Who do you think started rock and roll? Is it Elvis Presley, the so-called "King of Rock and Roll?"

**Surprise! Rock and roll came out of the blues and was initially largely shaped by Black artists. The problem was that in the 1950s, racist white people were clear that they didn't want to support a Black artist. So guess what they did.**
