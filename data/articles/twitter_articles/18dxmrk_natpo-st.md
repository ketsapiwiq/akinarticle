In January 2002, 20 shackled prisoners became the first inmates of the Guantanamo Bay detention centre. A total of 779 men have been held at the naval facility since it was opened. Eleven years later, 166 prisoners --- many of them on hunger strike\
to protest their conditions and incarceration --- are still there.\
