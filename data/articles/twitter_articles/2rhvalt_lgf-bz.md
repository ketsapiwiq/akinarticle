> Not only would President Donald Trump's proposed 2018 budget harm women and families by barring Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal government funding, it would also invest [\$277 million in abstinence-only education](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/budget.pdf), which has been shown to be a completely ineffective means of sexual education.

> As [Quartz](https://qz.com/989317/budget-trump-is-devoting-almost-300-million-to-abstinence-only-sexual-education/) reports, the proposed budget calls for investing \$277 million to "extend abstinence education and personal responsibility education program" between 2018 and 2027. The investment certainly falls in line with Vice-President Mike Pence's love of abstinence-only programs (and subsequent [lack of knowledge about how condoms actually work](http://www.thecut.com/2016/07/mike-pence-condoms-very-poor-protection-against-stds.html)). But it also completely disregards research showing that abstinence-only programs don't work.
