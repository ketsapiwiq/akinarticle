MENLO PARK, CA---Assuring users that the company's entire team of engineers was working hard to make sure a glitch like this never happens again, Facebook executives confirmed during a press conference Tuesday that a horrible accident last night involving the website's algorithm had resulted in thousands of users being exposed to new concepts. "Unfortunately, late Monday evening, a major failure in our news feed program allowed a significant number of users to come into contact with concepts unfamiliar to them," said CEO Mark Zuckerberg, appearing contrite as he emphasized to reporters that the issue had been resolved and that it was now safe to visit the social media site again without fear of encountering any opinions, notions, or perspectives not aligning with one's existing worldview. "To those who were forced to read a headline they did not agree with when they visited Facebook yesterday, we are deeply sorry. It's an inexcusable failing on our part if your viewpoints were not reinforced by what you saw onscreen. I want all Facebook users to know that you'll never again encounter any ideas on our site that are in any way novel or ideologically challenging to you---that's my personal promise." Zuckerberg then concluded the press conference by thanking users for their support, assuring them that a news article confirming their own individual political and personal biases would be directed to their news feeds with more information on Facebook's policy.
