The OECD\'s tool

**Compare your income**

 allows you to see whether your perception is in line with reality. In only a few clicks, you can see where you fit in your country\'s income distribution.

#### **Now find out what\'s your share of the pie!** {#now-find-out-whats-your-share-of-the-pie .BoxBodyText}

The tool is built using the most recent income data from the [OECD Income Distribution Database](http://oe.cd/idd), while for the questions related to perceptions of economic mobility data come from [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/), a non-advocacy, global fact tank.

While the information collected by this tool is completely anonymous and confidential, once sufficient information has been collected, the OECD will do different types of analysis with the anonymised information on users' perceptions and make it publicly available.
