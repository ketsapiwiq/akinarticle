What is Privilege?
------------------

> *We can define privilege as a set of unearned benefits given to people
> who fit into a specific social group. Society grants privilege to
> people because of certain aspects of their identity. Aspects of a
> person's identity can include race, class, gender, sexual orientation,
> language, geographical location, ability, and religion, to name a
> few.*

Privilege is the other side of oppression.
------------------------------------------

[![pr\_02](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_02.png){.alignnone

> *It's often easier to notice oppression than privilege. It's easier to
> notice the oppression you personally experience than the privileges
> you experience. Being mistreated is likely to affect you more than
> being treated fairly. So consider the ways in which you are oppressed:
> How are you disadvantaged because of the way society treats aspects of
> your identity? Are you a woman? Are you disabled? Are you poor? Do you
> have a mental illness or a learning disability? Are you a person of
> color? Are you gender non-conforming? All of these things could make
> life difficult because society disenfranchises people who fit into
> those social groups. We call this oppression. But what about the
> people society doesn't disenfranchise? What about the people society
> empowers at our expense? We call that privilege. Privilege is simply
> the opposite of oppression.*

> not a problem to you personally.*

Privilege describes what everyone should experience.
----------------------------------------------------

> *When we use the word "privilege" in the context of social justice, it
> means something slightly different to the way it's used by most people
> in their everyday environment. Often we think of privilege as "special
> advantages." Because of the way we use "privilege" in our day-to-day
> lives, people often get upset when others point out some of their
> privileges. A male acquaintance of mine initially struggled to
> understand the concept of privilege. He once said to me, "Men don't
> often experience gender-based street harassment, but that's not a
> privilege. It's something everyone should expect." Correct. Everyone
> should expect to be treated that way. Everyone has a right to be
> treated that way. The problem is that certain people aren't treated
> that way.*

"I'm not privileged. I worked hard for what I have."
----------------------------------------------------

> *Privilege doesn't mean you didn't work hard. Many people think that
> having privilege means you have had an easy life. As such, they feel
> personally attacked when people point out their privilege. To them, it
> feels as if someone is saying that they haven't worked hard or endured
> any difficulties. But this is not what privilege means. You can be
> privileged and still have a difficult life. Privilege doesn't mean
> that your life is easy, but rather that it's easier than others.
> Privilege doesn't mean your life is easy or that you didn't work hard.
> It simply means that you don't have to face the obstacles others have
> to endure. It means that life is more difficult for those who don't
> have the systemic privilege you have.\

> *Privilege simply means that under the exact same set of circumstances
> you're in, life would be harder without your privilege. As Phoenix
> Calida wrote, "Being poor is hard. Being poor and disabled is harder.
> Being a woman is hard. Being a trans woman is harder. Being a white
> woman is hard. Being a woman of color is harder. Being a black man is
> hard. Being a gay black man is harder."*

Privileges & oppressions affect, but don't negate, each other.
--------------------------------------------------------------

[![pr\_07](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_07.png){.alignnone
.size-full .wp-image-62 width="900"

> *All aspects of our identities -- whether those aspects are oppressed
> or privileged by society -- interact with one another. We experience
> the aspects of our identities collectively and simultaneously, not
> individually. The interaction between different aspects of our
> identities is often referred to as an intersection. The term
> intersectionality was coined by KimberlÃ© Crenshaw, who used it to
> describe the experiences of black women -- who experience both sexism
> and racism. While all women experience sexism, the sexism that black
> women experience is unique in that it is informed by racism.*

"How can I have white privilege if I'm white and poor?"
-------------------------------------------------------

[![pr\_08](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_08.png){.alignnone
.size-full .wp-image-62 width="900"
height="900"}](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_08.png){.wwm_socialshare_imagewrapper}

> *Being poor does not negate the fact that you, as a white person, are
> less likely to become the victim of police brutality in most countries
> around the world, for example. Being poor is an oppression, yes, but
> this doesn't cancel out the fact that you can still benefit from white
> privilege. Being white means that you have access to resources which
> could help you survive. You're more likely to have a support network
> of relatively well-off people. You can use these networks to look for
> a job. If you go to a job interview, you are more likely to be
> interviewed by a white person, as white people are more likely to be
> in executive positions. People in positions of power are usually the
> same race as you, so if they are racially prejudiced, it's likely that
> they would be prejudiced in your favor. A poor black person, on the
> other hand, will not have access to those resources, is unlikely to be
> of the same race as people in power, and is more likely to be harmed
> by racial prejudice. So once again: Being white and poor is hard, but
> being black and poor is harder.*

Privilege exists in the context of power systems.
-------------------------------------------------

[![pr\_09](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_09.png){.alignnone

> *Society is affected by a number of different power systems:
> patriarchy, white supremacy, heterosexism, cissexism, and classism ---
> to name a few. These systems interact together in one giant system
> called the kyriarchy. In a patriarchal society, women do not have
> institutional power (at least, not based on their gender). In a white
> supremacist society, people of color don't have race-based
> institutional power. And so on. It's also important to remember
> because people often look at privilege individually rather than
> systemically. While individual experiences are important, we have to
> try to understand privilege in terms of systems and social patterns.
> We're looking at the rule, not the exception to the rule.*

> *When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.*

"Are you just trying to make me feel guilty?"
---------------------------------------------

[![pr\_11](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_11.png){.alignnone

> *Often, people think that feminists and social justice activists point
> out people's privilege to make them feel guilty. This isn't the case
> at all! We don't want you to feel guilty. We want you to join us in
> challenging the systems that privilege some people and oppress others.
> Guilt is an unhelpful feeling: It makes us feel ashamed, which
> prevents us from speaking out and bringing about change. As Jamie Utt
> notes, "If privilege guilt prevents me from acting against oppression,
> then it is simply another tool of oppression." You don't need to feel
> guilty for having privilege because having privilege is not your
> fault: It's not something you chose. But what you can choose is to
> push back against your privilege and to use it in a way that
> challenges oppressive systems instead of perpetuating them.*

What can I do with my privilege?
--------------------------------

[![pr\_12](http://feministastic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pr_12.png){.alignnone

> *Understanding privilege is a start, so you've already made the first
> move! There's a great deal of information out there on the Internet,
> so I'd firstly recommend that you read more about the concepts of
> oppression and privilege in order to expand your understanding. But
> merely understanding privilege is not enough. We need to take action.
> Listen to people who experience oppression. Learn about how you can
> work in solidarity with oppressed groups. Join feminist and activist
> communities in order to support those you have privilege over. Focus
> on teaching other privileged people about their privilege. Above all
> else, bear in mind that your privilege exists.*
