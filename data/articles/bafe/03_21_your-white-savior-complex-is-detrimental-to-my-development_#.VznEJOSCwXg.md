](http://tmsruge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-2016-03-21-16.31.14.png "Your White Savior Complex is detrimental to my development")
Last week, I got an email question from a colleague (we'll call her
'Amy'). I asked Amy for permission to answer her question in a more
public forum, because this is a question I get quite often. And it is a
question that is difficult to answer without trampling on the
genuine---albeit, often naive---spirit of your everyday do gooder.

The answer has to be honest. It has to be blunt. And it has to convey a
truth to an industry insufferably full of self-righteous entitlement.
That industry is the international aid and development complex that has
come to be known as the White Savior Complex. The question, is presented
thusly:

> Hi Teddy I hope this finds you well. I've followed with interest your
> work and views on white saviour complex and it has really resonated
> with me. My work in Uganda is very important to me and I need to be
> seen in certain photos by my sponsors to show I am actually there
> doing the work I say I am rather than getting others to do it.
> Previously I was pulled up for NOT being in certain photos by a
> sponsor so how could he know for sure I was def there!!?? However I am
> extremely conscious that I don't want to look like the white saviour.
> But I do want people to see what I am doing, to raise awareness and
> generate more income especially to my \[redacted\] Uganda project
> which is micro financing women to start businesses. So I find that I
> need to be seen, but where is the line towards what is acceptable to
> raise awareness and generate funds and when you have crossed into
> white saviour. I REALLY do not want to be seen as a white saviour and
> would appreciate your thoughts on how I can ensure this never happens.
> Hope all good with you! ?

But before I proceed I do have to mention that much of what I have to
address has been discussed in three previously-written pieces that are
absolute must-reads for anyone grappling with what their role should be
in international development:

1.  [The white tourist's
    burden](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/volunter-tourismwhitevoluntouristsafricaaidsorphans.html)
    by Rafia Zakaria
2.  [The Reductive Seduction of Other People's
    Problems](https://medium.com/the-development-set/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d#.8p5f8l6w6)
    by Courtney Martin
3.  [The Problem with Little White Girls (and Boys): Why I Stopped being
    a
    Voluntourist](http://pippabiddle.com/2014/02/18/the-problem-with-little-white-girls-and-boys/) by
    Pippa Biddle

As a Ugandan in the development field, it is hard not to feel like a
raisin in a sea of entitled walnuts. I admit that the Educated Angry
African nickname my cofounders jokingly gave me at
[JadedAid](http://jadedaid.com) is well-deserved. It is hard not to walk
around your own community with a sense of resignation and defeat (and
quite too often, anger) at the elevated roles outsiders hold in my
community. [Reading this
shit](http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=8700af572c4efb20cd93d4e75&id=57884aa89c&e=1ba1795e04) can
be infuriating.

I can't answer Amy's question without bumping up against the various
imbalances created by white privilege. Geopolitically, Western countries
enjoy more privilege on our own continent than we do. An American or
Englishman's passport can breeze through any customs on the continent,
but I need to apply for a visa to enter Ethiopia or South Africa.
Socially, white skin is as good as a visa to do whatever your heart
desires in much of the Global South. White skin is the MasterCard of
global development, and membership has its privileges.

This excellent piece of privilege naval-gazing, [The Color of My
Skin](https://iknowwhomygodis.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/the-colour-of-my-skin/),
by Kezia Brinson spells it out:

> White person means rich. White person means any and every Ugandan man,
> or boy, will ask you to marry him, then and there, because he wants
> what's in your pocket. White person means you are lazy; you don't
> work, life is easy, and everyone works for you. White person means you
> have the power to give as much money as you want to anyone and
> everyone because you are so filthy rich. White person means you can
> fly to and from anywhere in the world, and you can bring anyone who
> asks; including the boda man who just drove you for two minutes and
> doesn't even know your name.

Kezia, a Canadian, is the poster child of White Savior hubris. She flew
thousands of miles to teach kids in \#Africa (with no teaching training
to speak of). Meanwhile, Canada's First Nations wallow in [abject
poverty](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/half-of-first-nations-children-live-in-poverty-1.1324232)
right under her nose.

Amy, I could say that it isn't your fault, that you were just born into
a system. But the unfortunate truth is that it is your fault because you
are an active agent of that system. The only options on the table are
you either educate your funders to understand that your very presence is
detrimental to what you are attempting to achieve, or you quit
altogether. Either way, you don't have to play along the same rules that
have you at an existential crossroads. True change, often, requires that
we do those things that scare us and seem almost insurmountable.

You need to ask yourself some hard questions: What is your primary
objective here? Are you doing this because you want to [feel like you
have done some
good](http://tmsruge.com/on-voluntourism-yes-again/#.Vu_3zccyfvk) in
this world? And the easiest, sexiest, most fundable way to do that is to
bring change *over there*? If the problem you are trying to fix *over
there* isn't fixed right *where you are*, what gives you the qualifying
authority to go *there*? And by leap-frogging the issues in your
backyard, are you really solving the problem or just moving sand grains
around on a beachhead? Why are problems *over there* yours to fix?

And while we are asking the tough questions, let's dig a bit deeper into
that geopolitical imbalance. If the "reductive seduction" that led you
to try and empower women in Uganda, left the women in your community
without access, how difficult would it be for a concerned Ugandan bitten
with the very same "reductive seduction" to try to go to your country
and solve the issue?

It's a trick question.

For those of us in the Global South, we think of going *there*, not to
solve your problems, but in search of better lives. Our "seduction" is
selfish and primal. And of absolute necessity. It's why we fake
passports. It's why we cross deserts. It's why we submit to human
traffickers. It's why the '*A sinking boat full brown people*' white
card exists in the JadedAid game. That primal need to migrate at all
cost is why we, in the middle of an unforgiving ocean, drown short of
the *promised* land.

It is important to ask yourself, "can a Ugandan do in *my* village what
I am freely able to do in *their* village?" If the answer is "no", then
what you are attempting to do will never be solved because there's a
much bigger imbalance preventing your efforts from ever being
sustainable.

My dear Amy, it hurts me to have to say these things to you, because I
know you to be a good and caring person who wants to contribute to the
betterment of humanity. But the truth is, *where* you are trying to
bring change matters as much as what *kind* of change you are trying to
bring. You are raising funds to empower women but not raising funds to
strengthen the social infrastructure that left these women
disenfranchised. The skin you are in, allows you to simply inject short
cut solutions to "other people's problems."

Fundamentally, social infrastructures in your village made you a strong,
independent woman with enough access to be able to think 'why don't
these women over *there* have the same privilege that I do?'. You
identified the illness, but opted for a corrosive bandaid instead of a
difficult, but necessary surgical procedure. There are many people in
Uganda, like me, working to fix our broken social systems by
incessantly petitioning our government to address them. After all, *they
have one job*!

Is what you are doing helping us strengthen our case against the
government or weakening our agency by endorsing the government's
abdication of its duties?

Doing good is arduous, slow, and often thankless. It requires years of
dedication to a singular focus. It's not a summer here, a week there. It
is not a GoFundMe, or bake sale. It is not a paper bead necklace
intervention. And as hard as it is for me to tell you, it's not about
the job here and there that you were able to create. It's about that
social system improvement you were able to influence which created an
environment where all the women in Uganda have the same level of
economic emancipation that you have, not just the women you choose to
help. And changing that, might be the tree you plant but whose shade
you'll never live long enough to stand under.

    I see a book..... As per the person who posted the question: One of
    her main handicaps is that she's a Christian missionary. Hard to
    rout that out of her. Marx said religion was the opiate of the
    people, one of the more honest and erudite things he said.

As usual you get me thinking. Since it's impossible to block
American/European intervention in African countries, one question is how
folks can contain/shape that intervention. Having successful examples
should help (non-White Savior projects that make money, employ people,
make good products/services, do good work, etc.)

    I've gotten great ideas on follow up blog posts to this issue and
    this is certainly worth exploring as one of the things I've always
    talked about is not so much Westerners owning and pontificating on
    platforms but being brave enough to hand over the microphones and
    stage time to those that have never had it. Thanks, will explore
    this further.

Thank you for your words of truth! As an American, married to a Ugandan,
living in Uganda, I really desire to constantly reconsider and reflect
upon the part I play here -- trying (and admittedly failing sometimes)
to be conscious and to minimize as much as possible my visibility and
presence in the social work my husband does. Thank you for giving me
more to think about!

    engage with everyone who is at least self-aware of the complexity
    their complexion brings to a developing environment like this. I

One of the things to remember about Christian missionaries is that their
stated purpose is really at odds with any kind of sustainable
development at all.

I mean, their first priority is to convert people. And the second is to
destroy the indigenous culture. It's just what they do, and that's kind
of the whole point.

And in that situation, when they visit the most vulnerable people,
there's nothing they are doing that *isn't* coercive at come level. If
you're going to be a missionary, then go convert the rich people first,
you know?

OTOH the churches have become a primary source of services in many
communities. So it's very hard to tease out. I don't think missionaries
are bad people, but walking into a situation without at least a
rudimentary understanding of what is going on seems to me just kind of
dumb at best, and simply dismissive of the people in whatever country at
worst.

Great points. It becomes complicated at that level. The missionaries of
course, are riding centuries of action that have pretty much given them
carte blanche to do what they "are called" to do.

And that is one of the reasons it is so difficult to deal with them.
Most of them are white, and privileged, and the believe that God is
sending them messages. White "man's" burden writ large.

    I think all around, any action can be justified by invoking "I was
    called by God to do this" or "it was God's will". Someone kills a
    room full of kids: "it was God's will." Why did you murder a theatre
    full of people: "It was God's calling." When you can justify
    atrocities by invoking religion, we are all vulnerable.

Lovely essay, but I am not sure what the conclusion is. Is it that white
people should take care as to what sort of work they do in Uganda and
other countries in the Global South, or is it that white people should
not volunteer in Uganda at all?

I ask because I've been that one white man in a Ugandan village once,
for a year. In fact, I'm a lot like Keiza: I am a Canadian that taught
in a Christian school in Uganda. The headmaster asked for a native
English speaker, and I agreed to go. Is that wrong? The comments confuse
me further. Not only was I wrong to go because I am white, I was wrong
to go because I am Christian?

I think (or at least, I hope) that isn't what you meant. I agree with a
lot of what you have said. Broken social systems need to be fixed, the
best place to do good is usually close to home, and local leaders and
workers should play a central role in development. With that in mind, I
think there is value in international and inter-racial co-operation for
the common good. Persons with different backgrounds can share new ideas
with each other, where a successful concept or technology from one
country can be applied to another country to hasten the latter's growth.
Furthermore, "voluntourism" can give foreign donors a view of that
bigger picture. I learned much about the problems in Uganda on my trip
that I would have never known had I not spent time there, and I think
the same can be said for many others. There is a wrong way to do it.
There is a right way to do it as well.

In conclusion, I welcome and thank your criticism, and I think it could
be expanded. Is there something you think white people could be doing in
your country that would help, and not hinder, your cause? Or if not, and
indeed white people should GTFO, could you explain a bit more as to why
we of paler complexion cannot be of any help over there?

Thank you, and God bless.

There are a number of issues that you speak to. One, the seemingly most
simple, involves white, Christian missionaries coming to various regions
of Africa to subjugate the indigenous population. Your religion, quite
frankly, regarded them as heathens. What gives you the right to
determine who is worthy and who is not? And don't tell me that your god
told that. Everywhere Christian missionaries have ventured for the last
five hundred years have resulted in the desecration of the cultures and
the people that they have supposedly come to save. What possible
incentive or gain can you possibly provide to Ugandan's, or Canada's
First Nations or other near totally marginalized people's who have been
colonized? Nothing. You're selling empty dreams. It's a delusion. Save
it for the inner city kids of your own city.

Hi Elijah,\
Thanks for your comment. It's really not my job to tell you what to do.
My job is to point out what should be obvious to people in the
missionary/development industrial complex (DIC) but isn't. What one does
with the insight I give is up to them.

In the 90's, I was a huge fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Captain
Piccard always stressed about never violating the Prime Directive, or
the policy of non-interference whenever they encountered a new culture.
But what they always (obviously) justified a reason to interfere anyway,
violating the Prime Directive. But as I've grown older, I realize that
the Prime Directive is a false assertion because their very presence to
a new culture was always a violation of the Prime Directive. If changed
the course of development for the cultures they encountered.

Similarly, Vasco da Gamma's curve around the Cape of Good Hope and
ensuing consequences that followed, forever altered the continent's
development. The White Savior Complex has been trying to centuries now
to "fix" it. It is irreversible and the longer you are here (wether
through missionary work, or through some sort of aid intervention) the
worse things get. Your very presence erodes the communities ability to
develop its own agency.

Just because the headmaster asked for a native English speaker doesn't
mean there aren't consequences to your arrival. You automatically
misplaced a potentially qualified teacher in the country who could have
done just as good a job. "I was invited" is not a good enough excuse to
ignore the consequences of your actions. We were colonized by the
British, our national language is English. We aren't short of teachers
to teach the subject.

The trip was about you, as you said, "I learned much about the problems
in Uganda..." But you didn't dig deep enough to get to the root of those
problems. Why is it YOU have to come here in order for the problems to
be solved. Have you asked yourself, why is it that they need foreign
donors? Yes, a cultural exchange is beneficial, but where's the exchange
part of it? You got to travel to a new culture and learn, but where's
the reciprocity. How many Ugandans came back with you to learn about
your culture, in situ?

One of the programs I love supporting is Global Health Corps, they have
a true exchange program. Internationals come to the Global South and
Global South fellows get to travel to America to actually work on local
issues to learn about similar problems before they come back.

Basically, if an intervention isn't reciprocal, it is not beneficial at
all to the local community.

Hi Teddy Ruge,

Thank you for your reply. However, I think you've made a few unwarranted
assumptions.

For example, your question of reciprocity: how many Ugandans come to
learn about Canada's culture? The answer is that there are far more
Ugandans working in Canada than Canadians working in Uganda. They may
not have come to "learn the culture", yet neither did I: that is a
side-effect, not the primary goal. They came to work: some temporarily
(on a work visa), others permanently (as landed immigrants). In a more
specific sense, do Africans come to serve in Canada for religious
reasons, affiliated with my own church? The answer is yes, they do.
Jared Purdy may not appreciate it, but the Christian church is one of
the few things that do exactly what you describe. I've known an
excellent pastor from Tanzania who I met in the Philippines and will
later go to Ireland to do cross-culture ministry. I've met Ugandans in
Canada, Kenyans in the US, and Angolans in Asia. Christianity it is
about persons from all nations, kindreds, peoples and tongues working
together to serve God and their fellow man. The church is a connected
and socially conscious global community.

You assume I did not think to ask why there is a need for foreign
donors. In fact, I had asked that question even before I went. How do
you think anyone is going to find out the answer, except to go to Uganda
and see for themselves? Why do you think that white people will somehow
have more insight into the root of the problem by staying away from
Uganda altogether? The vast majority of donors never visit the countries
they donate towards. The DIC would not disappear if white people stopped
visiting, and I believe it would actually get worse, as donors have even
fewer sources to tell them if some project is needed or will do more
harm than good. International co-operation is built on personal
relationships, and personal relationships rarely develop among persons
who have never met.

Yes, a Ugandan teacher could have taught the subjects I taught. However,
your assumption that there is no benefit to me coming there is, frankly,
untrue, because my presence (as an outsider who has different
experiences from locals) helped solve problems that the school did not
know it had, like the computers textbook and software being outdated,
the computers themselves suffering from repairable damage (viruses and
blown capacitors) that I quickly fixed, and the school library needing a
system to track where the textbooks are. It also answered questions that
the donors had and no-one gave an answer to, such as why secondary
school tuition is so much more expensive than primary school tuition.
This chance exchange of information happened simply because I was there:
two people with wildly different backgrounds putting their heads
together, facilitated by their presence near each other. Your experience
says that white people are hurting your communities by their simple
presence. My experience is that a pluralistic society like Canada or the
US is the best environment for growth and development because of the
interaction between different modes of thought. A good example is Japan.
Was Japan hurt by the high US presence after the War? No, Japan grew at
a rate previously unheard of and is now one of the wealthiest nations in
the world. I am not so pessimistic as to think that this is impossible
in Uganda, beautiful country with wonderful people and lots of
resources. This makes your assertion unconvincing.

White privilege will not be reduced by white people ignoring your
country. At the moment, you offer a lot of negatives and no solutions.
No, you do not have to tell me, or anyone, what to do. But saying "this
sucks" without suggesting anything better helps no-one. Share your ideas
for good, rather than merely pointing out what you think is bad. What
seems obvious to you is un-obvious to others because others are not
exposed to the experience you were exposed to, and the same works in
reverse as well. Indeed, what seems obvious to you may not even be true.
Not saying it isn't, of course: you do have good points, and I certainly
think there are better ways to do international aid than most NGOs
practice. But if white people simply stopped coming to Uganda
altogether, I doubt you would have better results than you have now.
White people would be less informed of what's going on over there, and
more likely to donate to causes that you believe are unhelpful, out of
simple ignorance.

There are vastly different reason why there are more Ugandan's working,
and in fact living in Canada than Canadians working and living in
Uganda: 1. Many came here as refugees fleeing Amin, 2. They are looking
for a "better", i.e., financially secure life. 3. Canadians, when they
get tired of the adventure, and the lack of infrastructure in certain
cases and places, just leave and can come back. Ugandans, are not in a
position to do that. Canadians and Americans don't go to Africa looking
for a better life, they go for an "adventure" because they can afford
it, and the missionary industrial complex has operated on the pretext
that they're "saving souls". Right, whatever. The majority of white
people who go to these "exotic" places learn little in the way of the
systemic globalized issues that contribute to the lack of equity in
areas like Uganda, and, they can always leave, and they do because they
know that they've got something to go back to. There are likely many,
many Ugandans who could have fixed those computers, and people who
understand library science, I mean there are schools and there is a
university in Kampala!!. The assertion that there isn't any tech savvy
people is absurd!! For white people to be less informed would make
absolutely no difference, and your implication is symptomatic of white
skin privilege and the white saviour industrial complex. Again your
premise is that things get fixed, and done, because white people know
about them, and are there. If you have't already watched, I urge to
watch "The Danger of the Single Story", narrated by Chimamanda Adichie.
Pay particular attention to the part where she tells her TED audience
that Africans are sick of being saved by a "kind white foreigner". Best
of luck.

    Jared Purdy, you have not understood my point. Yes, there are
    university-trained librarians and computer technicians in Uganda.
    Doubtless there are ones who are better at it than I am! However,
    were they in that rural village in Bundibugyo district? No, they
    were not. And why was that? Because they are in Kampala making a
    living and taking care of their kids. The headmaster could have
    sought them out, of course... if he knew where to look, and knew to
    look in the first place, and even knew that this was a problem that
    could so cheaply and easily be fixed to such benefit.

    Now, why was I there? Essentially at random. He called somebody who
    called somebody who called me, not knowing which particular skills I
    could bring to bear. Because vastly different people came together,
    we could look for problems and find new solutions.

    I watched the talk with Chimamanda Adichie, and you have not
    understood her either. She never says that Africans are sick of
    being saved by a "kind white foreigner", instead she warned of the
    danger of that being the single story, giving an incomplete picture
    of what Africa is about. Right now, you are guilty of doing exactly
    what she describes: you have a single story of a white missionary.
    Your single story is that of an ignorant and patronizing man who has
    little interest in the people that he visits, and so you assume I,
    and all other white Christians in Africa, are the same. So even
    though you had no reason to think I did not know about tech-savvy
    people in Uganda, you assumed I believed there were none, because
    that fit the single story you knew.

    I was there because I was willing to go. There are far more problems
    in the world to fix than there are people willing to sacrifice to
    fix them, so narrowing the possibilities means that problems that
    could have been fixed will not be, because the people willing to fix
    them are not there. Moreover, narrowing the possibilities means that
    this mixing of knowledge and ideas does not happen as well as it
    could, because fewer different experiences are shared. The fact that
    a white man came to serve them is neither a positive or a negative:
    it is just another facet in the stories shared. I did not take
    another, equivalent person's place, because no two people are the
    same. Had I not come, a Ugandan computer or library technician or
    wouldn't have appeared just because of my absence, and if there were
    one already there when I came my presence would not be in vain. We
    would have worked together to create something greater than either
    could have done alone. Even my white skin had its own, unique
    benefit, apart from what skills I could bring with me. It meant that
    a village that previously knew white people only from brief glimpses
    and letters could get to know one personally, and so demystify the
    white race in that town, showing that we are a lot more alike than
    we previously knew. If I had not come and a Ugandan person with
    similar skills did, it would also have its own benefit in that they
    would learn more about Ugandan institutions of higher learning. Each
    person brings their own gifts and features, and the more people
    interact, the greater the benefit will be.

    White people are part of Africa, just like black people are part of
    Europe and America. Sending the white people out of Africa would
    hurt Africa, just like sending the black people out of America would
    hurt America. Inequality is not made better by segregation, it is
    made worse. The portrayal of white volunteering as an entirely or
    even mostly negative force in Africa is wrong. White people and
    black people all have a part to play in the building up of the
    African continent and all the nations in it. The reasons for
    Africans coming to America are different from the reasons for
    Americans coming to Africa. We cannot change our history, and the
    present is unequal. We can, however, work together to make a future
    that is better than our past.

I'm not sure this actually ended up answering her question about how to
discourage associating her physical presence with evidence or
effectiveness of work. Ruge has many good points about the white savior
complex (which in my case might just be 'western savior complex'), but
his argument rambles. (Side note: I'm also very curious as to how Ruge
thinks JadedAid is actually working out, as the largest portion of the
population that plays it is most likely white. I personally have always
enjoyed playing Cards Against Humanity but haven't found the same appeal
in JadedAid and I wonder if it's because of the difference between
punching up vs punching down with the humor used.)

In response to Amy's question, I think I would tell her to maintain
self-awareness in the language she uses about her work, i.e. not
romanticize poverty or her own singular role within a community, and
also be confident in taking a stand against feedback that asks her to be
more present in pictures by a) offering to share other documents of
'proof' such as meeting notes, feedback from the women she is
collaborating with on the progress of the org, or offering to be a
liaison in arranging meetings between the businesswomen and the sponsor,
etc. and/or b) relating with the sponsor's concerns and then expressing
her own reasons for not being in the forefront of all the pictures, and
then finding a compromise.

I would be interested in hearing if you think this would be helpful or
what else you think could be done to limit the misconstrued view that
western savior = someone was saved.

Hi Swaffles,\
Thanks for the comment. These are some great suggestions and I am sure
she has tried some of the above to address the issue. To be fair, she's
already self-aware of her role and I think her reaching out to me is an
excellent sign of that. Most of the White Savior entourage that I come
across have a level of self-awareness. The majority that spoil the soup
for everyone are the unexposed and inexperienced ones that are here "to
find themselves" ... those are all too happy to Instagram their best
Mother Theresa impersonation with Brown kids.\
As a self-aware individual, I've seen her struggle to do it right, but
it is hard to achieve when you are playing with someone else's money. It
stretches beyond just selfies for donor approval. An overwhelming driver
of requests like this match donor requests for results that just can't
be achieved during funding cycles. They want to SEE a difference, when
real change actually takes several magnitudes longer to achieve than the
length of actual funding cycles.

I think it's complex, but you might also be onto something that we
musn't be too afraid to kick back and/or educate funders on their
unrealistic expectations. Educating the donor has to be part of the
doing good, correctly. Hopefully there's enough self-aware Amys out
there that can begin to do that.

As for JadedAid, it is very much skewed towards the White Savior Complex
as opposed to the minuscule all-encompassing Western (brown) Savior. As
a Diaspora in this space, (I suppose I could classify myself along the
lines of Western Savior -- but splitting that hair altogether another
post) I don't always feel empowered. It always feels like I am running
someone else's program in my community.

JadedAid came to life from almost 4000 contributions from the White
Savior community. These idiosyncrasies and observations are reflections
about their own industrial complex. The game in a way, is an inside joke
and skews slightly towards naval gazing. Our job was to curate the
submissions into something we could use as a catalyst for far more
meaningful conversations about the industry they work in. Get drunk with
buddies and play JadedAid on a Friday night, but come in Monday morning
and begin questioning how you or your organization could do your mission
or mandate more effectively.

We've seen great discussions happening at organizations and conferences
already so it is achieving results where it is supposed to be. It isn't
supposed to be an all encompassing "a game for everyone" like CAH, we
just borrowed the style of play. JA is actually designed to be played
WITH CAH should one so desire. We've tested it to great results.

    Thanks for responding. Everything you say about Amy here, I'm sure
    she would love to hear from you in person, as well. And it's true
    that the first step to change is being self-aware of one's role in
    his/her environment.

    My personal feedback on JadedAid: Perhaps my mistake was to attempt
    to play it by itself, but similar to the case with CAH, it feels
    self-serving. In that, the people I often play with already are
    rightfully cynical and questioning of their purpose and actions.But,
    unlike CAH, because the community fed in the answers, it feels that
    the phrases on the cards are uneven in intensity, self-awareness,
    and responsibility in directing the humor in the right direction
    (i.e. they should be mocking the institution rather than the
    victims). But in the end, congrats on making something that is
    enabling conversations, nevertheless!

I think white people can do good things in Africa, but it is important
to look at how we do it, and what stories we tell at home in Europe,
America or Australia. Do we work together with locals? Did we ask the
locals what they needed? Do we see ourselves as equal to the people
we're helping and do we act like equals? In colonial times, we saw
ourselves as superior, but I think today we can, and have to, work
together to solve problems. Africans already have more experience with
green energy and mobile banking than Western people, so soon there will
be a day, western people will be helped by African people too.

And what story do western people, western volunteers tell at home? Is it
the story that is told a million times, of the cute helpless children
with the flies in their eyes, the story of dancing and playing the
djembé? Or is it the other side of Africa, the story of people with the
same talents as we have, the story of mobile phones and skyscrapers?

The problem is our arrogance towards Africa, and that we don't tell the
truth back home. If white people really want to help Africa, they need
to change their mindset. Than Africa gets it's dignity back, and with
dignity the trade, which will mean so much more than food aid and
pencils.

    This, I think, is at the root of most development framing. As long
    as Africa is viewed as less superior, we'll never really have an
    equal seat at the table.

I am not Ugandan, but I'm gonna give my 2 cents as a Christian West
African woman, raised in Africa and who emigrated to Canada as an adult.

Canadian people are, from an early age, taught at home, at school,
everywhere that as Canadians, they're the world go-doers. They came up
with the concept of peacekeeping, they welcomed boat people from
Vietnam, the Haitians fleeing the Duvalier's regime, everyone prises the
Canadian passport (yep, Mossad'll definitely agree with that) and so on
ad nauseam. It is to the point that whenever they meet an immigrant in
this country, they'd think the person came to Canada, at best for a
better economic life, at worse as a refugee. They don't even know that
economic immigrants pay to get here and are, among other things,
selected because they're bringing some dough to the Canadian economy.
But I'm digressing here.\
So, when they want to help, they wouldn't think about helping the
homeless people from the first nations that you encounter everyday in
Ottawa or Vancouver, nope, they want to go to Africa or India and come
back with tales of how they help the poor there. Now is the time to call
me an Angry African woman, I've the right to because condescension is
annoying.\
If the person is Christian, let's say some old white Catholic priest
which prides himself on having spent years in some far-away African
lands, it is even worse. Indeed, you have a mix self-righteous desire to
help, mixed with a somewhat Eurocentric way of seeing things.

I think that when you really wanna help or are helping people, it should
be all about the people. They're the ones who should share the spotlight
while you're being the scenes. The sponsors are all about money. They
don't know how annoying it can sometimes be to have these pictures of
smiling African villagers wearing rags and the white humanitarian worker
in the middle. Yep, it does scream white savior.

I've lived in Canada and I bring up the argument of the state of First
Nations all the time. It is pure hypocrisy to feel like you have to fly
thousands of miles across the planet to plant your humanitarian of the
year award when right in your back yard, your own people are
disenfranchised.

Thanks for this perspective Anna.

Because this:\

Also because White Saviors are in power. If First Nations are going to
achieve equality and justice in their own country, they are going to
need White Savior Allies.

    Any cursory review of current literature on this suggests that you
    are right. Idle NO More, for instance, is calling for wide spread
    involvement of non-Aboriginal people. They routinely extoll the
    benefits of securing allies in government who are either white, or
    non-Aboriginal in general.

    Yes, but do not the same issues of privilege and being "uninformed"
    also apply there at home equally? Remember, the Natives may be in
    "your country", but they are not necessarily "your culture". If you
    go in there uninformed out to "save them" with the same attitude as
    the "white savior" you complain about going into Uganda, is that not
    going to be harmful just right same?

Let's try to see the forest for the trees. The USG provides \$250M a
year to Uganda for developmental assistance. I consider much of this as
providing life-saving support. For instance, The U.S. President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has provided millions of people
in sub-Saharan Africa with life saving drugs and support for families
struggling with AIDS. This aid might be referred to as a prime example
of the White Savior Industrial Complex. There's been some resentment
coming from the Ugandan upper class and intellectual elite. Perhaps this
is a reflection of embarrassment that their status is being undermined
or perhaps it is guilt that they are not leading efforts to help their
own citizens. The fact is that the Ministry of Gender Labor and Social
Development is grossly underfunded while President Museveni and his
cronies send their children to Ivy League schools in the US and Europe,
live in mansions in Kampala and elsewhere while crushing any political
opposition. I've always wondered if there was no external support in
Uganda, would there be a revolution. Is the White Savior Industrial
Complex stifling a legitimate uprising. Thinking back to European
history,.. if there were foreign donors and NGOs in 18th century France?
Would there be bread riots that led to the French Revolution? But then
again do we have the right to allow millions of innocent people to live
in abject poverty and die from famine and treatable diseases in hope
that eventually that the Ugandan people with take control of their own
government?

Not sure how you can ask "do we have a right" when it is actually going
on right now. Thousands are dying on a monthly basis in Syria and
drowning in the Mediterranean sea and the world is collectively ignoring
it and closing their borders to immigrants seeking safe haven.

Do no underestimate humanity's propensity to ALLOW atrocities to happen
with full knowledge.

With every generation comes new geopolitical catalytic ingredients for
revolution. Sometimes, time and the unexplained trigger can spark a
revolution from out of nowhere, see Sid Bouzidi in Algeria. Just a lone
vendor with no political ambition, suddenly his struggle resonated with
millions and down came a regime.

    To be blunt: yes, I'd love them to stop. But that's not how the
    world runs.

    Governments borrow from each other all the time. The US is heavily
    indebted to china. But china doesn't dictate how US spends that
    money.\
    It's a lot more complicated than that. Government to government aid
    is not the same as white Saviors. To a degree, it does contribute to
    a white Savior mentality.

    How development aid is done is the problem. Not that aid is given at
    all. How matters.

    This is not a fair comparison. China's investments are not charity
    and the US pays huge sums in interest on these loans. Through his
    pretentious tweets, Teju Cole has made it trendy to hurl racial
    insults at wide-eyed volunteers naively trying to help people.
    Eventually some of these volunteers will become jaded bureaucrats
    administering the bilateral aid. There is a privileged class in
    Africa that benefits from not having to pay for their social welfare
    systems that are essentially being bankrolled by the "white savior
    industrial complex". Teju's native Nigeria brings enormous oil
    revues; enough to take care of all of its population and then some
    and yet there's still abject poverty due to endemic corruption in
    Nigeria. I think you're both too timid to confront the real
    villains. These young do-gooders are easy targets. I don't think you
    and Teju are the heroes, nor are the credulous young volunteers. The
    real heroes are leaders making incredible sacrifices to confront the
    real problem, like Kizza Besigye and his followers.

Let me see if I follow you: US BORROWS money from China, but US DONATES
money to Uganda, and therefore is entitled to accountability for that
money. Would let Ugandan people without ARVs and medical care appease
your anger towards white savior? How far are you willing to go with it?
I assume your life does not depend on this funding or on these
medications, so you, as the privileged person you are, can freely and
inconsequently speak against it. Lastly, goverment aid is no different
than private donors aid, its foreign money that could be spent with
homeless in Boston but is being spent with HIV in Africa, because thats
the biggest humanitarian tragedy of all times. Now get over yourself and
think of those whose lives quite literary depend on those awful white
saviors narcisistuc bastards money

You are welcome! In sum, millions of well purposes money from PEPFAR is
welcome, but volunteers teaching engish its not. Got it, makes sense. I
hope you are able to look at your own privilege to make the statements
you do. Cheers!

    I paid for my privilege. Under no circumstances do I plan on
    apologizing for something I earned. Sounds like you prefer Africans
    who don't check you when you assume you have a god-given right to
    tell us how to live.\
    Thanks for the comments.

No PEPFAR and other forms of bilateral aid are too difficult to deal
with... a far easier target are young volunteers naively thinking that
they are helping people... "Goddamn white privileged a-holes making me
feel guilty for doing something that I should be doing.." LOL... You
don't think that the average Peace Corps volunteer had to work hard to
get through school and will be burdened with student loans for most of
their adult life?... I think you're basically just a hater trying to
ride on the coat tails of a the pathetic hipster, Teju Cole.

I should add I do not under any circumstances have to answer to you or
apologize for wanting my country, my people to be self-reliant. Nor
should I have to apologize for being self educated enough to
disambiguate the detrimental actions of white saviors and helpful
structural direct foreign assistance to our country. If that makes me
privileged then that a compliment. Thanks.

You owe me no apologies. And myself being a mixed person from a
developing country share your feelings for self reliance, deeply and
honestly. I just think it is so important to gauge this conversation
from the perspective of people whose lives, like in PEPFAR, depend on
that aid. Not on yours or mines, blogging from our Iphones with high
speed internet. I did not mean to offend you and I apologize

    I get the difference. My family was devastated by AIDS. I have an
    entire generation of cousines who grew up without their parents
    because AIDS wiped them out. Every week we had a funeral. Our
    country made great strides in understanding what was going on and
    educating ourselves and changing behaviors. Did pepfar funding help?
    Yes! But we also had to do the work to rescue ourselves because HIV
    was new to us. It took time but we got there. But just because
    PEPFAR assistance was a success doesn't mean we HAVE to accept
    uninformed gap year kids to run around our communities doing thing
    they aren't qualified for. If we can't do that in their communities,
    why do they think they have a right to our communities? That's my
    argument. We can't build our agency by allowing that kind of
    unqualified, unreciprocated intervention. We all need each other in
    one way or another, but HOW that help is administered is the
    difference between agency erosion and institution building.

    Ok, now I fully agree with you. You should not have to accept
    unqualified workers in your community,as they d not do the same back
    in US or Canada. I guess I wanted to make a point that aid or white
    money/presence it s not inherently bad and that so many precious
    lives were changed by it.

You mention about doing things at home, at your "own backyard" so to
speak, yet one should also note that the very same issues of privilege
(racial, class, etc.) also apply there too. "Your own country", or
"home", is never equal (no matter which one it is), and if you're
looking to "help", chances are that \_right there\_ puts you in a
privilege category of some kind over the ones \_at home\_ you are
"trying to help", if you are in a position where such a thing is even
possible. So what do you do then? It seems the very same problematics
you mention about "helping 'elsewhere\'" ALSO apply to helping "at
home". If I go into an inner city area to "help", and "inner city" means
"poorer, blacker area", then I am going in with at least racial
privilege, and if I had any modicum of wealth greater than theirs, with
class privilege too. In my OWN country. What do you have to say
regarding that? If such privilege issues mean you "shouldn't even
bother" internationally, then wouldn't they logically also mean you
"shouldn't even bother" domestically, \_too\_? If so, then it sounds
like we should just never try to aid anyone at all who is less
advantaged than us -- but then some others might crow "Apathy!" How
would you respond to that? It seems to me like swinging to the other
extreme.

Also, what would be the best way to really address the \_systematic\_
inequalities and problems? What is the best way that an "ordinary"
person could have any effect on that, to any, even if small, but
nonetheless "adequate to their share of the responsibility", extent?

And looking at it, my suspicions do indeed appear to be confirmed, e.g.:

<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/31/the-stars-atoning-for-hollywood-s-sins-against-native-americans.html>

<https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/white-saviors-are-never-around-when-i-need-a-jar-opened/>

And indeed, many of the concerns opined about "white saviors" operating
on Native Americans, that is, privileged Americans operating on
less-privileged groups \_in their own home grass\_, \_in their own house
where you say they should be operating\_, run into the \_EXACT\_ same
types of problematics that they do in Uganda. EXACTLY as I suspected.

What do you say about that? It seems to me that reading this, if you are
not educated and conducting yourself to the SAME "extremely high
standard" that would be required to be fit to help Uganda, you
\_shouldn't be helping at home, EITHER!\_.

Hi Mike, thanks for reading and commenting. It seems there's a running
thread in your introspection about helping your local community as I've
suggested. If you feel too privileged to go into a First Nations
community to help or a black community, perhaps you should petition your
local government or national government to actually do something about
those marginalized communities. After all, they run on platforms of
making sure they represent their constituents needs and priorities. As
an individual, you might not have the power to do a whole lot to stop
the streets of Chicago from being the bloody mess that they are by
showing up there, but you could do a lot petitioning congress -- writing
a petition to the executive branch, rallying your community to stand up
for the marginalized. Privilege doesn't mean you just walk into any
community without context and try to fix the problem yourself, it is HOW
you do it. Find out who the local leaders are who are trying to bring
change to their communities and ask them HOW they need help. There are
First Nations/Native American activists. There are urban community
organizations. Lend them a hand. Be an ally. Change, believe it or not,
starts at home. Thanks again for reading.

Thx. Sounds a lot like what someone else I know would probably have
said.

Regarding:

"Change, believe it or not, starts at home."

my concern was not that I disagreed with that, but rather that the same
issues that you talk about that apply internationally ALSO appear to
apply at home, Too. And thus there isn't, it seems, quite as much
difference in terms of the "burden of ethic" it places upon the
prospective "helper".
