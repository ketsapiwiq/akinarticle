On Being Non-White, But Passing Terribly Well {#on-being-non-white-but-passing-terribly-well .entry-title itemprop="headline"}

*"Psst... Hey, Patty! You speak Spanish? Ignoring me? Hey! You speak
Spanish?"*

P.E., third period, seventh grade.

Every time Ricardo saw me, he would ask me the same question.

At first, I would answer yes*,* but he would always get me back with a
"Nah, prove it. Say something." I never did.

I would often imagine myself yelling, "*¡Que sí, güey! ¿Ya cuántas veces
te tengo que decir, pues? Pinche metiche,*" but in reality, my face
would blush and my hands would sweat in frustration such so that I'd
slip while trying to do a pushup.

I stopped talking to most kids at school when I moved to a new district
at five (also when I was given a "new" name by my white teacher who
pronounced it wrong; I didn't have the voice to correct anyone until two
years ago), and I didn't really start again until high school. I wasn't
going to open up for Ricardo.

**But Ricardo wasn't the first person to demand proof, to demand to know
why my last name and my appearance didn't make sense to them** ("*Pues,
es que mi familia es de Nayarit y Jalisco." "Aaah, bueno, por eso."*),
and he wouldn't be the last.

Folks around town knew my dad as *el güero* (a nickname rooted in the
fact that he has light skin, but also in fondness, *como de cariño*),
but kids at school and church, who knew I was Mexican, called me white
girl (zero *cariño*). I took offense.

Growing up in a largely Mexican immigrant town, my conception of white
people and the lives they led was based almost entirely off of
television.

According to TV, white kids had just one or two siblings, they went on
family vacations, and they had "full course meals."

My food, my family, my *virgencita*, my language, *mi México lindo y
querido* were all absent. **I felt that by calling me white, those kids
were denying my cultural experience and denying my right to
self-identify.** So it pissed me off.

But I was wrong. Or rather, misguided.

The liberal arts college I attend is an elite institution, painfully far
from home, but with a good need-based financial aid package that keeps
trying to convince me that I made the right choice in going.

I've struggled a lot there.

I've felt unintelligent, as though my kind of knowledge was not
valuable, as though something was wrong with me because I couldn't read
or "think critically" like the other students. I've felt alone,
unsupported.

But when a series of events unfolded across my campus, and many minority
students stood up and demanded support and accountability for
microaggressions (and many aggressions that were really systemic in
nature), **I realized that I was not alone, but also that I was
separate.**

Many of my peers were exhausted. It was clear that this was a battle, in
defense of their humanity and worth, that they had been waging their
whole lives. Of course, they were fearless and strong nonetheless, but I
could see that theirs was an experience I simply could not know.

**I pass for white, *easily*.**

And regardless of how I was raised or how I see myself, that has made a
difference. When I went to get enrolled in my new elementary school, I
was told by the older woman leaning over her desk to make eye-contact
with me that I was going to be put on A-track "with all the other smart
kids."

She didn't know me. My mom didn't speak English, and I certainly didn't
say a word to her. There were few white kids at my school, and they were
all on A-track.

**White privilege encompasses many things that I do not and cannot
benefit from, but I do benefit from a lot and it's very important that I
recognize it.**

To name just a few of those benefits: the quality of my English is never
going to be commented on in a first encounter, I see people who at least
look kind of like me represented in the media all the time, and I will
probably never have to worry about being followed for "suspicious
behavior" in a convenience store.

I can't claim to know what it's like to be immediately cast as the
*other*, as threatening and undeserving.

Beyond where the color of my skin places me within US racist/colorist
society, I also need to be cognizant of what of my Mexican *herencia* I
present, both as a white presenting person in the United States and a
light-skinned person in Mexico.

The Spanish word *herencia* means both heritage in the sense of where we
come from and inheritance in the sense of what is passed down. So while
it is true that my Mamá Nina was a *mujer indígena*, it is also true
that she was kidnapped by my mestizo great-uncles to marry my Papá Nel.

Her cultural experience has been erased in my family's history such so
that no one knows anything about the life she led before she was taken.
**There is an inherent whitening that comes with *mestizaje,* and with
whitening, erasure.**

I am often bothered by the sight of a white girl with a "traditional
Mexican style" purse or backpack, but at the same time I probably know
just as little about the significance of those particular patterns
decorating the items.

So then, what does it mean for me to sport them, simply because I grew
up surrounded by them, when I look very much like those girls whose
comfort with cultural appropriation upsets me so?

As a white/light-skinned person, I feel that I have a responsibility to
present an alternative to an identity that bases itself on taking what
isn't theirs. With my sweet mami by my side, I have found comfort in my
Chicana identity, in returning to the world of experiences that I know
and questioning those aspects which my newer experiences have
complicated.

I have been invited by friends *(and other people who simply read my
name on a list and made assumptions)* to Women of Color Luncheons and
closed groups, but I've never gone because Person of Color is an
identity I've struggled to pick up and I decided that, for me, I simply
can't.

I feel that my responsibility is in allyship work, in the role of ally
to POC (as I am, for example, in the work against ableism,
trans\*phobia, and for the rights of those folks who are undocumented)
because I look white and I can in no way claim a POC experience.

It doesn't matter that all my *primos* on this side of the family can or
that my grandparents and great grandparents could. I feel like I can't.

*Soy queer chicana, sin dinero*, but I am not visibly non-white and
sometimes (a lot of the time), I've got to work *in support* to ensure
that other voices get heard.

**The struggle against the white capitalist patriarchy does not involve
a competition to see who is the most oppressed, but rather it should
offer an invitation for everyone to see where they are privileged where
others are not and to adjust their behaviors accordingly.**

To other white-presenting folks out there, be careful.

They're going to want to use us for nasty things like silencing cries
against the erasure of bodies of color in the mainstream media (*"But
\[green-eyed, light-skinned Latino\] is Hispanic! We're not racist"*) or
other such bullshit, but we can point out the bullshit and say no.

We must be responsible.

We must not be afraid to check our privilege and use it when we know we
will be heard, and that our friends and family are tired. Because we
love them, we cannot stay silent or immobile.
