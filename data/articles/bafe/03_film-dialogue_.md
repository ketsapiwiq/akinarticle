Film Dialogue

from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age

Lately, Hollywood has been taking so much shit for rampant sexism and
racism. The prevailing theme: **white men dominate movie roles.**
:::

::: {.prose-first}
**But it's all rhetoric and no data**, which gets us nowhere in terms of
having an informed discussion. How many movies are actually about men?
What changes by genre, era, or box-office revenue? What circumstances
generate more diversity?
:::

::: {.prose-first}
We didn't set out trying to prove anything, but rather compile *real
data*. We framed it as a census rather than a study. So we Googled our
way to 8,000 screenplays and matched each character's lines to an actor.
From there, we compiled the number of words spoken by male and female
characters across roughly 2,000 films, arguably the largest undertaking
of script analysis, ever.

Let's begin by examining dialogue, by gender, for just Disney films.

2,000 Screenplays: Dialogue Broken-down by Gender

Only High-Grossing Films: Ranked in the Top 2,500 by US Box Office\*

In January 2016, researchers reported that [men speak more often than
women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/25/researchers-have-discovered-a-major-problem-with-the-little-mermaid-and-other-disney-movies/)
in Disney's princess films. We validated this claim and doubled the
sample size to 30 Disney films, including Pixar. The results: 22 of 30
Disney films have a male majority of dialogue. Even films with female
leads, such as Mulan, the dialogue swings male. Mushu, her protector
dragon, has 50% more words of dialogue than Mulan herself.

**This dataset isn't perfect.** As with Mulan, a plot can center around
a character, even though the dialogue doesn't reflect it. And all of our
data is based on screenplays, not a perfect transcription of a film.

Methodology

For each screenplay, we mapped characters with at least 100 words of
dialogue to a person's IMDB page (which identifies people as an actor or
actress). We did this because minor characters are poorly labeled on
IMDB pages. This has unintended consequences: Schindler's List, for
example, has women with lines, just not over this threshold. Which means
a more accurate result would be 99.5% male dialogue instead of our
result of 100%. There are other problems with this approach as well:
films change quite a bit from script to screen. Directors cut lines.
They cut characters. They add characters. They change character names.
They cast a different gender for a character. We believe the results are
still directionally accurate, but individual films will definitely have
errors.

Each screenplay has at least 90% of its lines categorized by gender. If
you notice a missing character from the analysis, their lines may be in
the remaining 10%. If a character was cut from the film but is present
in the screenplay, we inferred his or her gender based on the script's
pronouns.

Across thousands of films in our dataset, it was hard to find a subset
that didn't over-index male. Even romantic comedies have dialogue that
is, on average, 58% male. For example, *Pretty Woman* and *10 Things I
Hate About You* both have lead women (i.e., characters with the most
amount of dialogue). But the overall dialogue for both films is 52%
male, due to the number of male supporting characters.

How many screenplays have women as lead characters?

In 22% of our films, actresses had the most amount of dialogue (i.e.,
they were the lead). Women are more likely to be in the second place for
most amount of dialogue, which occurs in 34% of films. The most abysmal
stat is when women occupy at least 2 of the top 3 roles in a film, which
occurs in 18% of our films. That same scenario for men occurs in about
82% of films.

Aging out of Hollywood: Men vs. Women

For each film, we also determined the age of each cast member at the
time of its release. This allowed us to quantify whether there is a bias
toward younger women in Hollywood (or conversely, whether men enjoy a
longer career).

Percent of Dialogue by Actors' Age

Among 2,000 Screenplays, all genres, all years
:::

::: {.body-container .tk-merriweather}
The amount of dialogue, by age-range, is completely opposite for
[women]{.women-color} versus [men]{.men-color}. Dialogue available to
women who are over 40 years old decrease substantially. For men, it's
the exact opposite: there are *more roles* available to older actors.

Here's another look at the same data, but for every age:

Why we made this

This project was born out of the less-than-stellar response to our
analysis of films that fail the [Bechdel
Test](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/bechdel/). Commenters were quick to
point out that the Bechdel Test is flawed and there are *justifiable*
reasons for films to fail (e.g., they are historic). By measuring
dialogue, we have much more objective view of gender in film.

Many of readers are drawing conclusions that were *anecdotally obvious*
to women in the film industry. But nobody wanted to do the grunt work of
gathering the data. We spent weeks just matching scripts to IMDB pages.
It's still not perfect, but we're now in a much better place than *"you
know\...women are never love-interests when they're older than 40.
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"*

[an FAQ that
