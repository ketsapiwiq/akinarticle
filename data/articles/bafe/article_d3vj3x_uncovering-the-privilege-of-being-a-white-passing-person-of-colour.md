I am a \'white-passing\' person of colour; a white-passing
British-Iranian woman of colour to be exact. I am in no way ignorant as
to the privilege this gives me in a still very much racialised world in
which the after-effects of colonialism and imperialism are all too
evident and dark skin is seen as anything from unattractive to a reason
to kill. I am aware that in a culture in which fair skin is still valued
higher than those of brown people whether in the fashion industry, on
the internet or just at family gatherings, I am lucky. I am
white-passing, and I have white-passing privilege. In short, this means
that I am not necessarily immediately recognisable as a \'brown
person\', an \'other\'. Make-up companies cater to my concealer and
lipstick needs, \'flesh-coloured\' plasters and crayons are roughly the
right shade. Due to the fact that I have spent my whole life living in
the UK, I suffer from Vitamin D deficiency and am therefore more likely
to be mistaken for Italian/Spanish rather than Middle Eastern for 9
months of the year. I would like to make it very clear that I am in no
way trying to claim I suffer the same kind of discrimination based on
skin that black or dark-skinned Asian women do; I don\'t even suffer the
same kind of discrimination as other Iranian women who are darker than I
do.

::: {.ad-unit__container__container}

But I do suffer discrimination. I am white-passing, not white. And
interestingly, it often seems to be white people rather than other
people of colour who are darker than me who are quick to announce my
non-eligibility for discrimination and to tell me I\'m white. I have
experienced a long and varied history of this from both white friends
and anonymous white strangers on the internet.

A couple of years ago, I went travelling around Central America with a
white girlfriend. As we travelled through these countries, my friend was
always very quick to let me know that \"I was just as out of place as
her\" and \"looked just as white\". It never seemed to occur to her that
I wasn\'t and didn\'t. It never occurred to her that when I was walking
around on my own and not with her, people would talk to me in Spanish
rather than English and often assumed I was either Argentinian or at
least half Latino. If I ever tried to tell her my experiences of the
region were very different when she wasn\'t by my side she would simply
laugh at me and tell me I was deluded. This is the white privilege of
dictating other\'s experiences, of feeling comfortable enough to dismiss
the feelings and lived experiences of POC because the thought of
everyone not fitting into neat black or white boxes is unthinkable.

Sure, I may have \'white passing\' privilege in London or on Tumblr
where diversity is de facto but take me out of these very particular
places and I am no longer white. I am not white-passing in the English
countryside. I am not white-passing whenever I tan which is essentially
less of a \'tan\' but the colour my skin was meant to be if my
grandparents had not chosen to live in a country in which it\'s overcast
on average for 70% of the year. My features are not white: particularly
my nose, hair and abundant body hair. I was in no way white-passing when
I was a teenager with a unibrow and a moustache in hijab. My sideburns
alone stop me from being white-passing even now. I was not benefiting
from any kind of white privilege when I was called a p\*\*i following
9/11. In fact, I was never classed as anything except brown until Kim
Kardashian became famous and everyone (incorrectly) decided she was
white. As an aside: it is interesting to note that the Kardashians are
definitely white-passing now, but only after having undergone extensive
surgery and laser hair removal to achieve a particular look. Indeed,
when the Kardashians first came to fame, much of white mainstream media
was quick to make jokes about their hairy faces, and Kim has since come
forward to admit she lasers everything from her forehead to her arms. In
his 2012 film *The Dictator*, Sacha Baron Cohen responds to Megan Fox
asking \"what do you think I am, a Kardashian?\" with \"Of course not,
you\'re much less hairy\". Obviously body hair is an issue for women of
all ethnicities, but being called \'hairy\' is often an insult reserved
for WOC, particularly those of Middle Eastern/South Asian descent.

This phenomenon in which pale POC are told they are white is prevalent
online too, particularly when social justice issues are being discussed:
white people have a thing for focusing on light skinned POC\'s \'white
features\' and attempt to strip us of our ethnicity. I published an
article about white privilege in regards to body hair feminism from my
perspective as an Iranian woman and returned to at least 3 comments
below it telling me that Iranians are in fact white. I began wondering
what exactly white people had to gain from telling brown people that
they look and/or are white? One explanation is a discomfort with being
white. In a time where many people are now more aware of nuanced forms
of racism and concepts such as privilege, white people are more likely
to be aware of and experience white guilt. One outcome of this can be
\'ethnic shopping\' i.e. claiming to be from a different race other than
white (claiming to be 1/18th Native Cherokee Indian so you can justify
wearing a headdress to a festival). In this case it is almost a reverse
of this: the discomfort with whiteness means that they \'ethnic shop\'
*for you* - that is, to deal with their own discomfort, they lump us
into a more privileged \'white-passing\' category thus taking away our
actual lived experience and re-fashioning our identity as
privileged/more privileged for personal gain.

This is essentially a form or gaslighting; telling a white-passing POC
that they are white is pretty much nothing more than bullshit designed
to throw you off and insinuate that whatever problem you\'re having
\"isn\'t that bad\" or is non-existent based on their Higher Authority
as a White Person. As mentioned previously, light-skinned POC do
undoubtedly have privilege over darker-skinned POC but a white person
taking an authoritative stance on this issue is inherently disingenuous
- telling you that you are white is meant to make you feel bad for
complaining, but in truth they don\'t really care about darker-skinned
people\'s problems either. After all, white people are still the
gatekeepers of whiteness, and \'whiteness\' as a concept has not
historically always been tied to skin colour. What \'white\' is changes
over time: Jewish, Irish, Greek, Spanish, and Italian migrants to the
United States are all examples of ethnic groups once rejected for their
supposed \'racial inferiority\' but who have now fully assimilated into
whiteness due to a willingness to play by its rules. James Baldwin
argued that being white \"is not a colour, \[but\] an attitude\" - that
is, it is less defined by what you look like than it is a social
structure for the gifting of power to some and the social and economic
disenfranchisement of others. On his blog \'aRR\' Kenji Kuramitsu talks
about \"whiteness\'s frantic, obsessive drive to organise immigrant
groups against black people, who are viewed as the idle, perpetual
counterpoint of the American dream\".

::: {.ad-unit__container__container}
::: {.article-iac__wrapper}
:::
:::

Anti-blackness is the founding stone of whiteness, and all assimilation
into white culture is framed against it. To relate it back to the topic
at hand, white people who tell POC that they are \'white\' are
perpetuating the idea that you\'re \'one of them\' as long as you agree
to be a safe space in which they are free to act like bigots and will
keep quiet about your race issues. They are unwilling to acknowledge
your cultural background or otherness, especially with regards to their
accountability to you and other POC. In short, they don\'t really give a
shit but don\'t want to admit it.

No matter how \'white\' we may look, it is not we as POC who have the
agency to designate the borders of whiteness. The \'benefit\' of
whiteness can only be bestowed upon us by a white person and is only
accessible through what is essentially a renunciation of our ethnicities
and experiences. Furthermore the privilege of whiteness can be taken
away far more easily than it is given: for example, although the US has
historically classified Iranians as white (perhaps due to relations that
were previously warm and \'Western-friendly\') anti-Middle Eastern
sentiment following 9/11 has proven that not all those who are
classified white on a census form are easily absorbed into whiteness.
Indeed, Iranian sociologist Neda Maghbouleh\'s work looks at the idea
that Iranian-Americans \"live a racial paradox\" in that although the
state understands and treats them supposedly as \'white\', they are not
treated as such by the world in their everyday experiences. She states
that \"We have this long tradition in sociology of studying when
\"brown\" groups or groups that have been racialised become white. It\'s
usually a story of impugning other minorities, ascending through social
class, becoming rich enough to become white, and my case is really
interested in the opposite. What happens when a group that has
historically been categorised as white has enough racialising
experiences such that it\'s not when brown becomes white, but when white
becomes brown.\"

Being a person of colour with white-passing privilege means that my
experiences of discrimination will never be akin to those with darker
skin, to those whose otherness is painted clearly across their face and
not only evident when you are at a close enough range to recognise
racialized features. However to have my identity reduced to white by
well-meaning white friends and strangers on the internet is a silencing
of my lived experiences. We do not need to register on a Pantone scale
whereby we are classed as \'brown enough\' by a white gatekeeper for our
identities to matter. I appreciate the privilege my pale skin affords
me, but allowing white people to decide the boundaries of what
constitutes non-white is inherently dangerous, particularly as the
borders of whiteness are policed often in self-interest rather than out
of genuine attempts at inclusivity.
