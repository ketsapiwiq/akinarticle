::: {.entry-content}
The word "accessible" is thrown around a lot. When people use it to
refer to activism in Cambridge (The Women's Campaign, the BME Campaign)
one of the main criticisms they level against those involved is centred
on this idea. The campaigns have a reputation for being "unfriendly"
"not widely supported" or even, "getting things wrong." More people do
not engage with them because their fear of making a mistake on a
Facebook discussion page outweighs their investment in the issues they
claim to support.

It is perhaps an unspoken truth that many (white, middle class, cis)
people have silently felt locked out of these activist spaces because
they resent not being able to exist in them uncritically.  By this I
mean, a lot of these people's engagements with feminism stop when things
become "difficult." When they are asked to move past the realm of overt
displays of gendered discrimination, of sharing articles about blue and
pink boxes, interviewers asking sexist questions and Donald Trump's
position on women's issues. These are all worthy of attention of course
but when they are asked to consider subtler more complex issues: sex
work, the gendered effects of migration and war, borders,  how "power
feminism" (the desire to get women into boardrooms) often depends upon
the labour of racialised migrant women who provide childcare -- It is
then I am often met with the claim that the campaign's concerns,
practices or terminology are "inaccessible." These issues are too clunky
for consideration, they get stuck in your throat if you try and swallow
them.

Instead of facing the complexity of these feminist issues head on, many
hide away under the guise of "accessibility" and "political
correctness." They claim they feel "stifled" or that they are "not given
the space to learn" because online interactions become fraught when
intersectional issues are brought up. If your engagement with feminism
or feminist spaces stops because somebody's tone becomes too
"aggressive" for you... what is the extent of your commitment to
practising the kind of feminism that liberates "all" women? If you can
be so easily dissuaded from a space because you do not understand what
is being discussed, and refuse to use the tools that you employ weekly
for your essays to find out, how important are the lives of marginalised
women to you? The claim of accessibility is an important one but when I
see it misused by those who have the means and the privilege to educate
themselves or challenge their thinking, I can only assume that what they
really mean is "I don't care *that* much." I want everything explained
to me as nicely as possible, I do not want to be made to *think* about
feminism especially because it is supposed to be so *simple*.
Accessibility matters for those who need it most -- by that I mean
working class women and non-binary people for whom academic feminism is
alienating and perhaps doesn't speak to their experiences in the same
way that a well-written article or blog could (I am one of them.) Those
who are living with the real world consequences of the things we discuss
in femsoc on a Tuesday night whilst drinking free wine. Feeling sad
about being challenged or corrected because your intentions were good
does not help these people. What separates those who are invested in
practicing feminism that is truly meaningful from those who are merely
performing their interest is the ability to learn and relearn, to listen
and change their ideas. To hear the voices and critiques of marginalized
women and change their feminism accordingly.

<div>

Another gripe I have with the the claim of "inaccessible" feminism is
how it robs those already on the fringes of mainstream feminist
discourse, of their anger. If the response to a heated defence of why
race and gender are inseperable, criticisms of Emma Watson or Taylor
Swift, is "the language of intersectionality makes this space
inaccessible for me" "I don't understand why I have to think about race
when all I want to talk about is gender" then, as a white woman, what
you are signalling to other white women is that you have a certain
ownership over feminist space and praxis. It is a position that is not
only intellectually dishonest, but lazy. It is, in itself, a form of
violence -- by silencing dissent or criticism of mainstream/white
feminism, what you communicate to the most marginalised women is that
their demands for recognition are somehow a step too far. If thinking
about intersectionality kills your enthusiasm for feminism, then what
you are suggesting is that I am a nuisance.

<div>

I want to kill fluffy, flowery, insubstantial feminism just like Woolf
asked us to kill the Angel in the House. I want it gone. It is of no use
to anyone. I would also like to kill the myth that feminism is simple.
Feminism is not simple -- recognising how structures constrain women and
how oppressions are linked to capitalism and austerity can be a lot to
wrap your head around. That means that if you care about the plight of
migrant women, you must care about and advocate for the rights of sex
workers. If you care about BME women, you must be critical of the "power
feminism" that relies on the unpaid labour of BME women. You must be
committed to thinking critically about how concepts created and coined
by black women "radical self-care" "intersectionality" are packaged back
to us and sold for profit. You must credit women of colour for their
tireless work in the feminist movement. You must be invested in feminist
history. You must be less concerned with asking "Is X a feminist thing
to do?" more concerned with asking how women in the most ostracised
professions are paid, treated and represented. This is not the same as
saying "You must read a certain number of books about feminism and then
you will receive a 'good' feminist badge." It could be as simple as
reflecting on how the articles that you like, share, and post might
resonate with women who are not rich, white, able bodied, neurotypical.
Would the message be the same? Put simply, you must *care* about the
lives of women and non-binary people who do not look like you.

<div>

I am not purporting to have all the answers. But I am very tired of
going to femsocs that discuss 'controversial' topics like sex work
without a nuanced understanding of how anti-sex work rhetoric, whether
it be theoretical or otherwise, kills women. I am tired of those who
claim to be interested in feminism relying on trans-exclusionary
theorists or gently spouting TERF (Trans exclusionary radical feminist)
ideas. Our seeming silence on the mistreatment of trans women and
non-binary people in our feminist spaces is also something that needs to
be addressed in a meaningful way. I know that the university-wide
feminism that I wish to practice should take into account how all the
differing aspects of my identity shape my experience of womanhood. I
want others who do not share my experiences to recognise me and others
like me, lift up our voices, at the very least attempt to radically
rethink their spaces (feminist socs, events) so that they are, yes,
*accessible* and welcoming environments for *all* women and non-binary
people. I want clunky, complicated issues to be at the forefront of any
feminism we claim to practice.

    It isn't that people find "clunky, complicated" feminism hard to
    stomach because they find it difficult or "inaccessible." For the
    most part, we're just sick and tired of people with massive chips on
    their shoulders laying into white, cis people with personal attacks
    because you dare question their orthodoxy. You have no right to
    claim to have complexity in your position if that "complexity" can't
    deal with simple questions like "why should feminism criticize
    capitalism" without trundling into an ad-hominem filled,
    unintelligible, badly pseudo-Marxist rant that demonstrates a
    complete lack of understanding of basic economics.

    Thank you for your good words; I have felt this frequently in my own
    FemSoc as a non-binary person. I was wondering if you'd contribute a
    view on a difficult question I've been struggling with ---
    engagement in feminist self-critique versus spoons and/or emotional
    energy. This has been a serious blockade to my reading as a mentally
    ill person and I have conflicting feelings on whether I should be
    forgiving of myself or pushing myself to unlearn my own harmful
    behaviours.
