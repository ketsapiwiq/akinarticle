The term \"cultural appropriation\" is bandied about a lot these days
--- largely when a fashion line or a famous person plays into a look or
accessory that had its origins in another culture and pays no attention
to what it means or where it comes from. [Miley Cyrus\' alleged
appropriation of African-American
culture](http://jezebel.com/on-miley-cyrus-ratchet-culture-and-accessorizing-with-514381016){.PlU}
has been one of the biggest such talking points recently. For instance,
Nicki Minaj raged against [Cyrus cherry-picking of black culture in
*The* *New York
Times*](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6721924/nicki-minaj-miley-cyrus-beef-vmas){.PlU}.
\"If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us,
dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you
should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we
feel is unfair to us. You shouldn't *not* want to know that.\" And
that\'s one of the key problems with cultural appropriation: It uses
other cultures as cute accessories, rather than real things with meaning
to real people.

One famous case of cultural appropriation is the Native American feather
headdress, which is now [banned at several festivals around the
world](http://www.oystermag.com/cultural-appropriation-isnt-cool){.PlU}
--- and woe betide any starlet who thinks it\'s \"cute\" to pose in it
on Halloween or Instagram. (Yes, Kardashians, this means you.) But this
stuff still runs deep: Even Victoria\'s Secret sent [Karlie Kloss down
the catwalk in a tone-deaf \"Native American\"
getup](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/karlie-kloss-victorias-secret-headdress-fashion-show_n_2091958.html){.PlU}
in 2012. So you know that\'s out of bounds. But what about other
cultural artifacts?

Basically, the key question to ask yourself if you\'re thinking of
wearing something religious or ceremonial is: Are you part of that
culture? No? Then you should probably step away. Just because it\'s a
trend doesn\'t mean it\'s in any way OK. Still not sure? Here are five
trends that your might not realize are cultural appropriation.

### Bindis

sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px"
srcset="https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 1292w"}

**What They Really Mean**: Bindis are purely for women, and they have
many different [specific cultural meanings in
India](http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/culture/bindi-meaning-and-significance-of-the-dot-on-forehead/){.PlU}.
Red ones are for married women and symbolize love, while black ones are
for widows. They\'re situated between the brows at the site of the Third
Eye, and function as a spiritual reminder for Hindus of their faith and
duties at times when they aren\'t at prayer.

**Why You Shouldn\'t Wear It**: [Selena Gomez has shown a distinct
liking](http://jezebel.com/why-selena-gomezs-bindi-is-not-okay-475214428){.PlU}
for these in the past year or so, but the increasing appearance of the
mark on the foreheads of fashionistas around the world --- under the
excuse that it\'s \"so \'90s\" --- is not impressing people who wear
them as, you know, part of their culture. [The hashtag
\#ReclaimTheBIndi](http://magazine.good.is/articles/reclaim-the-bindi){.PlU}
is ruthlessly speaking truth to the hordes of people who apparently
think they are a cute hippie accessory instead of a religious tradition.

### Bantu Knots

sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px"
srcset="https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/487734413.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/487734413.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/487734413.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/487734413.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 1292w"}

**What They Really Mean:** These small buns all over the head may have
had their [origins in the Zulu tribe in the southern part of
Africa](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/28/bantu-knots-mini-buns-difference_n_7452532.html){.PlU}.
Since then, they\'ve been part of African culture for centuries, and
have spread all over the world. They\'re often used as an [overnight
style for natural
hair](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/celebrities/rihanna-calls-her-bantu-knots-ghetto/){.PlU}.

**Why You Shouldn\'t Do It:** Bjork loved them in the \'90s, but taking
on the bantu knots if you\'re not a black woman is increasingly seen as
pretty culturally insensitive.

### Day Of The Dead Makeup

srcset="https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/458305680.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/458305680.jpg?w=349&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/458305680.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/458305680.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&dpr=2 1292w"}

**What It Really Means:** The [Day of the
Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead){.PlU}, or Dia de
Muertos, is a hugely significant Mexican holiday. People come together
to pray for dead family members and hold various rituals. Its roots are
thousands of years old.

**Why You Shouldn\'t Do It:** The proliferation of Day of the Dead
makeup on Halloween is [beginning to rightfully piss off some Mexican
people](https://ayadeleon.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/dear-white-peoplequeridos-gringos-you-want-our-culture-but-you-dont-want-us-stop-colonizing-the-day-of-the-dead/){.PlU},
who point out that it\'s a fundamental part of their culture\'s
perspective on life and honoring the dead --- not just a pretty, creepy
bit of makeup. The \"colonization\" of Day of the Dead by non-Mexicans
is deeply uncomfortable for them. Best to rethink this Halloween costume
if it isn\'t actually your culture.

### \"Chola\" Style

:::
:::

**What It Really Means:** This is trickier, as it\'s not part of an
established culture or religion, but the look of a very particular
subset of society --- which *does not* appreciate being made into weird
\"fashion symbols\" while the reality of their lives is neglected.
[Chola
culture](http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/aug/15/-sp-chola-style-cultural-appropriation-fashion-crime){.PlU},
which involves pronounced eyebrows, lined lips, and a distinctive
fashion sense, [emerged in Mexican-Americans communities in the \'80s
and
\'90s](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-history-of-the-chola-456){.PlU},
and was a defiant statement of identity in a very racially charged
environment.

**Why You Shouldn\'t Do It:** Chola style has shown up everywhere, from
the backdrop of Gwen Stefani\'s \"Luxurious\" video (oh, Gwen) to Katy
Perry\'s hairstyle in \"This Is How We Do\" (she should really know
better). The real problem isn\'t that chola style isn\'t great --- it is
--- but that (often, white) [people are either borrowing it without
paying any attention to its
roots](http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/aug/15/-sp-chola-style-cultural-appropriation-fashion-crime){.PlU},
or are actually making fun of it. That is about 14 types of racist and
uncool.

### Indian Bridal Jewelery

**What It Really Means:** Indian bridal jewelry is absolutely stunning,
and you can understand why people would want it all over them. But the
reality is that the pieces a bride wears at an Indian wedding are all
very context-specific, and have unique meanings. *Payals*, or anklets,
are meant to [symbolize the arrival of a wife into her husband\'s
house](http://www.bollywoodshaadis.com//articles/significance-of-9-bridal-jewellery-for-indian-woman-2906){.PlU}.
The beautiful *maang tikka,* or hair accessory falling down the part in
the middle of the hair, marks a specific chakra, and has deep spiritual
significance. Even the [nose ring,
or](http://www.indiamarks.com/nose-rings-not-just-a-fashion-statement-in-india/){.PlU}
*[nath](http://www.indiamarks.com/nose-rings-not-just-a-fashion-statement-in-india/){.PlU},*
has cultural associations, depending on where in India it\'s being worn.

**Why You Shouldn\'t Do It:** Indian bridal jewelry, just like henna, is
not something you can shove onto yourself out of context without
expecting people to be confused and affronted. At best, you\'ll look
like a poser (yes, you, [Kendall
Jenner](http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014313/rs_634x1024-140413203108-634.Kendall-Jenner-Nose-Ring-Coachella.ms.041314.jpg){.PlU}).
At worst, you\'ll look insulting (side-eye, [Vanessa
Hudgens](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2252027/Vanessa-Hudgens-courts-controversy-Instagram-meditating-like-late-famed-sitar-player-Ravi-Shankar.html){.PlU}).
It\'s possible to delight in the glory of a particular culture\'s skill
in jewelry-making without, you know, insulting them by wearing it
completely out of its intended context as a cute thing at Coachella.
