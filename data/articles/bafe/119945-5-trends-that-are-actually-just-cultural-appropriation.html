largely when a fashion line or a famous person plays into a look or accessory that had its origins in another culture and pays no attention to what it means or where it comes from. <a class="PlU" href="http://jezebel.com/on-miley-cyrus-ratchet-culture-and-accessorizing-with-514381016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Miley Cyrus' alleged appropriation of African-American culture</a> has been one of the biggest such talking points recently. For instance, Nicki Minaj raged against <a class="PlU" href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6721924/nicki-minaj-miley-cyrus-beef-vmas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cyrus cherry-picking of black culture in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i></a>. &quot;If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn’t <em>not</em> want to know that.&quot; And that's one of the key problems with cultural appropriation: It uses other cultures as cute accessories, rather than real things with meaning to real people.</p><p>One famous case of cultural appropriation is the Native American feather headdress, which is now <a class="PlU" href="http://www.oystermag.com/cultural-appropriation-isnt-cool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">banned at several festivals around the world</a> — and woe betide any starlet who thinks it's &quot;cute&quot; to pose in it on Halloween or Instagram. (Yes, Kardashians, this means you.) But this stuff still runs deep: Even Victoria's Secret sent <a class="PlU" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/karlie-kloss-victorias-secret-headdress-fashion-show_n_2091958.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Karlie Kloss down the catwalk in a tone-deaf &quot;Native American&quot; getup</a> in 2012. So you know that's out of bounds. But what about other cultural artifacts?</p><p>Basically, the key question to ask yourself if you're thinking of wearing something religious or ceremonial is: Are you part of that culture? No? Then you should probably step away. Just because it's a trend doesn't mean it's in any way OK. Still not sure? Here are five trends that your might not realize are cultural appropriation.</p><h3>Bindis</h3><figure class="weq"><div><div class="mKk" style="padding-top: 146.1276%;"><div class="eZr"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/lovelace/getty/469558986.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt class="Eds" /></noscript></div></div></div><figcaption><cite class="EaV">Rachel Murray/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</cite></figcaption></figure><p><b>What They Really Mean</b>: Bindis are purely for women, and they have many different <a class="PlU" href="http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/culture/bindi-meaning-and-significance-of-the-dot-on-forehead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">specific cultural meanings in India</a>.

At best, you'll look like a poser (yes, you, <a class="PlU" href="http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014313/rs_634x1024-140413203108-634.Kendall-Jenner-Nose-Ring-Coachella.ms.041314.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kendall Jenner</a>).
