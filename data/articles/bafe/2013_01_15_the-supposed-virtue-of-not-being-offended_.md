**Alternate title: YEAH WELL I'M NOT OFFENDED SO WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
OFFENDED BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF I'M NOT OFFENDED IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AND
WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE THE EXACT SAME FEELINGS ABOUT EVERYTHING**

I often encounter people who are Not Offended by bigotry or
[microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) and
are very proud of that fact. In fact, because they're Not Offended, they
think that nobody else should be offended by the thing they're Not
Offended by, either.

It's difficult for me to criticize those people because, often, they've
been through a lot. They're survivors of sexual assault who [don't see a
problem with rape
jokes](https://jezebel.com/5925186/how-to-make-a-rape-joke?post=50893557).
They're people with mental illnesses who don't care if you tell them to
"just snap out of it." They're women who don't care if they get
catcalled on the street. They're gay men who don't care if you call them
"f\*\*\*\*t."

Sometimes the way people cope is by growing a thicker skin. While that's
not something I've ever really been capable of, it's none of my business
how other people cope. It's also none of my business what other people
are and are not offended by.

When it becomes my business, though, it when such people start implying
that because *they're* not offended, nobody else should be, either.
That's when they lose me. It seems like some people haven't really
learned that 1) everyone is entitled to their feelings, whether those
feelings are "rational" and "logical" or not, and 2) your feelings don't
have to be everyone else's feelings too.

The other issue with this is the sense of superiority that such people
often have. Being Not Offended becomes somehow morally better, or a sign
of strength or "maturity" or "perspective." It's also assumed to be the
"healthier" option, because being offended means you're "holding a
grudge" or something equally ridiculous.

Of course, even if being Not Offended were healthier, that wouldn't
really matter because it's not a choice. While we can choose whether and
how to act upon our feelings, we can rarely choose which ones to have.
It's not really your choice whether to be upset by something or not, and
I believe the technical term for considering yourself superior to others
because of things they can't control is Being A Dick. (If you'd like to
change the feelings that you automatically have in response to things,
you could try therapy, but that's not available to everyone and the
stigma associated with it is still significant. So at best you're
shaming people for not going to therapy.)

To some people, being offended also means you're wasting your time
nitpicking people's language as opposed to working on Real
Issues, [which is an argument I often come across but have yet to see
proof
for](https://freethoughtblogs.com/brutereason/2012/11/05/argumentum-ad-third-world-or-think-of-the-starving-children-in-africa-redux/).
Is there actually an activist out there who does *nothing* but police
people's jokes and language? If you run across someone who criticizes
your jokes or language, how do you know they don't do *anything* but
that with their life? You don't.

None of this means that you have to be offended by something just
because others are. For instance, I have no problem with casual usage of
the word "crazy," but many other people with mental illnesses do. I
understand why they do, but for some reason hearing that word thrown
around just doesn't provoke any emotional reaction from me. I also
occasionally use that word to describe myself. However, I never use it
to describe other people, and I try to avoid using it casually in public
because I'm mindful of the fact that others find it offensive. (Also,
it's just such an [imprecise and lazy word to
use](http://whatprivilege.com/replacing-crazy-for-ableism-and-preciseness-of-language/).)

But I would be wrong if I said that because I'm not offended by the word
"crazy," nobody else should be, either. I would be wrong if I considered
myself more mature or healthier than those who find that word offensive.

Speaking of imprecise word choice, "offensive" and "offended" are prime
examples. When people speak dismissively about those who get "offended"
by "politically incorrect" jokes or comments, they make it sound like
those of us who dislike such jokes and comments are just choosing to
take righteous offense because we're so sanctimonious and
more-liberal-than-thou. While that might be how it works for some
people, for many others it's a very different sort of emotion that it
evokes. These comments *hurt*. They make people feel pigeonholed and
objectified. They make them feel like the butt of a joke they never
asked to be the butt of.

It's telling, I think, that whenever I see discussions about how "being
offended" is a waste of time/a sign of immaturity/not compatible with
Real Activism/a "character flaw," I never see any compassionate advice
for those who find themselves inordinately upset by bigoted comments.
All I see, really, is self-indulgent gloating about the virtues of Not
Being Offended.

Nobody's taking your freeze peach away. If you'd like to offend people,
go for it. But prepare to face criticism for that choice. Personally,
I'd like to live in a world where if someone hurts someone else with an
ill-considered comment that serves no actual purpose, they'll apologize
and seriously consider not making such comments in the future rather
than lording their Thick Skin and Maturity over the person they've
accidentally hurt.

Microaggressions can actually have pervasive negative effects on people,
and [research backs this
up](http://books.google.com/books?id=jyzcuvgTaIMC&dq=microaggressions+in+everyday+life&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s).
They activate [stereotype
threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat), which is a
process in which people underperform based on stereotypes about their
race or gender when those stereotypes are made salient for them.

If you've managed to overcome that, good for you! Now stop looking down
on those who haven't.

    A shocking experience for me was meeting a Black woman from the
    rural south who told me that the confederate flag didn't bother her
    that much. To me, I grew up thinking that it was a moral duty to be
    offended by certain things and not let people get away with them.

    To me, saying "I'm not offended so you shouldn't be either" is like
    a person who says that they got shorted out of a money on a paycheck
    and since they didn't make a big deal out of it, I shouldn't either.
    If you want to 'suck it up' or something, go ahead, but don't tell
    me I shouldn't.

    Part of this might be that the person who 'doesn't get offended' is
    working on a different strategy; appealing enough to the insensitive
    members of society, or the dominant majority, that they think
    they'll get better treatment. You might be right that it's coping
    though, a way of saying "I'm stronger than you people who get
    offended." Sometimes I ask someone why they don't get offended. I
    mean, why rape jokes funny? I'd like someone to explain that to me,
    because beyond offended I just don't get how that can be funny.

    I get so confused about these things and it just makes me never want
    to talk to people ever. I'm already awkward enough, and it's so
    crappy to feel like you have to walk on eggshells around everyone
    about everything. We were just having this conversation in the
    Secular Woman group regarding whether people asking about your
    religious practice is a microaggression.

    I'd never heard the term microaggression before so this is all new
    to me. But it almost seems like it could apply to ANYTHING that
    isn't the status quo that might make one upset.

    If you ask me "Do you have kids?" or "When are you having kids?" I
    am liable to break down in tears and hyperventilate. I'm shaken by
    it currently and it sort of offends me. But is that to say you
    should never ever ask someone when you are playing "getting to know
    you" as adults if they have children? Simply because I am going
    through some tough times regarding the societal pressure as a woman
    in a heterosexual marriage? I wouldn't expect these questions to be
    struck from American vernacular because I am going through a crisis
    (I am sure one that many women my age share, but we don't talk about
    much).

    Though, I understood microaggression as something to be purposefully
    insulting. But then the definition also states that the
    microaggression can occur whether insult is intentional or not?
    \*sigh\*

    I just don't want to hurt feelings.

        You don't sound like an agressor, micro or otherwise. You sound
        like a thoughtful person who's confused by your own culture. As
        long as you let other folks know you have a sensitive spot
        regarding children, I don't think you will hurt any feelings.

    I think that what Miriam was talking about (or at least, what I've
    observed in conversations in which people try to tell others that
    they shouldn't be offended by what they're saying) is that mistakes
    are common -- but if a person is really trying to interact with you
    in good faith, in a decent way, then they would refrain from doing
    or saying things that they **know** are offensive to you.

    You've already listed something that would negatively affect you if
    someone said it to you. Now, let's say that a person who asked that
    question made the judgment that you were over-reacting to that
    question, and that they think you shouldn't. They think you're weak
    or thin-skinned for reacting in the way that you do. So they go out
    of their way to ask you that same question over and over again,
    every time they interact with you. Let's say they've begun to think
    of this as an issue of Free Speech, and have created entire blogs
    and forums to specifically create spaces where they can exercise
    their "right" to ask that question -- of you, or anyone, regardless
    of how people feel about it. Does that feel a little excessive to
    you? Far out of proportion to your supposed "over-reaction" to the
    original question?

    People slip up in conversation -- I know that I do. I definitely
    don't like to hurt people. But there's making a mistake, and then
    there's being an asshole.

        Yeah... I think I understand better now. Just after having this
        discussion in another place about "microaggressions" and seeing
        it here, I think I felt super sensitive. Since, I came to the
        understanding that a microaggression is one, whether the person
        who causes it intends to insult or not.

        I suppose I got confused when someone suggested that "What is
        your religious affiliation?" is a microaggression. I'd argue
        that it's not, and that the intention of the question is
        EVERYTHING.

        But of course I would never accuse someone of taking my "Freeze
        Peach" (I love that term) if they told me they were upset by
        something I asked.

            Nicole, I think that context very much matters. In Germany
            where I live most people don't give a flying fuck about
            people's religion, so asking about it is more a chit-chat
            stock item. It's different in the US.\
            Also the children question (and I would say "do you" is a
            very different question from "when will you") can be
            different in different contexts. And the main thing is: even
            if I asked a seemingly innocent question, and it just really
            got you (becuase you have been put under pressure, because
            your family planning didn't work out the way it did...) I
            don't get to tell you: Stop being so offended! Instead the
            sensible thing is to say "I'm sorry that I offended you, it

            You can never know where somebody's triggers lie, what
            button you might push. Still there's a stock of
            microagressions that can easily be avoided, like the
            stereotype that heterosexual women are baby-factories.

    A major problem with the SJ framework is that the high ground always
    goes to the person who is offended. You can be a person who has
    actually survived *x*; you can state respectfully and in good faith
    that you do not believe word, phrase, or sentiment *y* reifies
    oppression by being expressed; your opponent can fail to have any
    citations backing them up. But they're "right" and you're "wrong."
    Moreover, you are written off as "derailing," having "internalized
    \[oppression\]," "failing to educate yourself," etc.

    I've got a psych medical history, including hospitalizations for
    depression. I am not on board with any number of assertions I have
    seen over the last several years by alleged anti-"ableism" types.
    Those involving language policing irritate me in particular. I do
    not have much compunction about stating that, yes, I have better
    priorities than someone who complains about words like "scab" (in
    the union sense) or phrases like "What's the matter with you?"

    Really, how do these people function offline? I strongly suspect
    that a number of SJ warriors play the "You can't say that!" game
    because it allows them a sense of power they can't get elsewhere in
    their lives.

        I agree, but that's not what I was addressing here. I was
        specifically addressing the concept that not "being offended"
        means you're a stronger/better/more mature person than those who
        do get "offended."

                    That is inevitably how it ends up, though. The
                    "Ableist Word Profile" on FWD, no matter how often
                    that bunch claimed it was not a list of forbidden
                    words, *became* a list of forbidden words.

                    Maybe she'd like to take that up with some of her
                    closest associates. I'll note that it wasn't really
                    until maybe two years ago that people in her circles
                    started expressing their sadness over SJ dogpiles...
                    mainly because the behavior had come back to bite
                    them.

                    As for Smith *per se*, I think [this
                    page](http://failfandomanonwiki.pbworks.com/w/page/59327168/s%20e%20smith)
                    sums up a lot of my objections. (Yes, it's from the
                    wiki to a community that dishes a lot of gossip.)

    I think your heart's in the right place, and that's a really good
    start. But, the response that worries you doesn't need to be so
    extreme. This post is mostly talking about when people have
    communicated that something is hurtful to them, to avoid doing it
    with them. (As an add-on, it's also nice, though perhaps not
    necessary, to ask new friends if something could be hurtful to them,
    so that you can avoid it.)

    Also, there are examples of being rather "universally sensitive," so
    to speak. Some people would call it being "politically correct," but
    it's not a matter of politics so much as knowing that there are
    certain things, like rape, or name-calling (esp. historically
    offensive things, like f\*\*\*\*t, or the N word, etc.) that are
    generally perceived as harmful.

    But on the whole, the best thing to do is look out, and listen/be
    compassionate when people tell you something hurts their feelings,
    and try to avoid doing it around them. That's really the bottom line
    of what's being gotten at here. It's a really good thing that you
    care, but that doesn't mean you have to fear talking to people. Just
    listen as well, and you'll be A-OK. 🙂

    Ms. Daisy Cutter,

    Is that why I don't see you around much anymore? Tired of seeing
    conversations derailed because someone saw a single word used in a
    non-aggressive context and they have to follow the person to
    multiple comment threads complaining about them?

    I almost lost my own shit a couple of months ago when I used the
    word "ghetto" and someone told me I shouldn't because it is
    "racially charged". Since I'm a) from the ghetto, b) not a white
    guy, and c) was at the time living in an actual ghetto where the
    residents referred to it as such, it was hard to take that complaint
    seriously. On the other hand, I don't care to fight about it that
    much. I have other words.

        Joe, that's a big part of it. It gets tiring to be caught
        between MRAs and the like on the one hand, and then people who
        are supposedly on your side on the other. I don't recall the
        "ghetto" incident, but given your situation the word was
        entirely appropriate for you to use IMO.

        And, yeah, you mention what I forgot to in my previous comment:
        There are some people who glom onto SJ movements because they
        enjoy policing others, and they will fixate on the smallest
        "violation." There are also communities in which the mindset has
        gone so far (e.g.,
        [Shakesville](http://shakesville.tumblr.com/)) that you really,
        actually *do* have to walk on eggshells... unless you're in the
        site owner's clique, that is.

        I should mention to Nicole at \#3 that this is a completely
        different situation from accidentally hurting someone's feelings
        in conversation, or triggering them, with language that is not
        widely regarded as offensive. If you do that, and you apologize
        sincerely and refrain from using that word or phrase in future,
        nobody who is worth associating with will have a problem with
        you.

    To be a little more on topic: I don't need to be personally
    hurt/offended by a word to understand why other people might feel
    that way. It is called "empathy" and if people practice it enough it
    should start to come more easily to them. I grew up Hispanic in one
    of the tiny towns near Mayberry. People would see my last name and
    assume I had trouble speaking English even though I had an easier
    time with grammar than the Southern stereotype that many of them
    more than lived up to. Let me tell you, THAT is a kick in the crotch
    that is hard to describe to anyone who hasn't experienced it.

    So yeah, I get it. I don't have to share your specific details to
    understand being discriminated against... and if a specific word
    triggers you, I'd rather not use it.

    I don't think everybody gets a blank check to be offended and cause
    the folks around them to refrain from using a word for any old
    reason whatsoever. For instance, there was a movement afoot to boot
    the words "niggardly" and "picnic" out of the language, based purely
    upon false etymologies. And I recall a story about a search
    committee a few years ago that was accused of being sexist because
    it used the word "dynamic" to describe the person they wanted to
    hire, and somebody thought dynamic was a code word for males. (I
    personally found that particular person's offense to be offensive
    --- all the most dynamic I've had have been women, and I think
    anyone who says women can't be dynamic is pretty bigoted.)

        "Boot them out of the language" is a bit of an exaggeration.

        I barely remember the "picnic" incident, but I do remember the
        "niggardly" one. Before it happened, I wouldn't have thought
        poorly of someone who happened to use the word in conversation.
        Since then, however, wingnuts who have never previously evinced
        any particular love for the language seem *suspiciously*
        invested in protecting this word. It's become a dogwhistle, in
        other words, and it's one I'm just as happy to avoid at this
        point, given that there are plentiful synonyms for "stingy" in
        English already.

        "Picnic" is nowhere near as, er, evocative-sounding as
        "niggardly," and it fills much more of a lacuna in English, so
        I'd side-eye anyone seriously arguing for it not to be used.
        Then again, I've really not heard of same.

                It doesn't surprise me. I've heard just about every word
                with some resemblance to a slur being used in such a
                manner.

                One of the low points of this phenomenon was a white
                couple who encouraged their very young kids to talk
                about "sparking wiggles," and YouTube'd a video of them
                shouting, not entirely clearly due to their age, things
                like "Get a job, Sparking Wiggles!"

                (Anyone who doesn't "get it" is welcome to go find the
                video on YouTube for themselves and watch it.)

    On the word 'niggardly.' It is true that the word has a different
    origin than the n-word, but it sounds so similar that I wouldn't use
    it or advise using it. Way too many white people like that word too
    much.

    Perhaps this is just me, but I've never felt paralyzed by fear of
    offending people, perhaps because for people I know, i make it clear
    that I don't \*want to\* needlessly offend people (except people
    whose beliefs I want to mock, if I offend them, that's the point.)
    Now and then I realize I've said or written something that might
    offend someone, or that I should be more sensitive to a population,
    and then I try to change. I've never felt like I've had to walk on
    eggshells.

    The problem is some people, if they're offered the slightest
    suggestion that they might have said something they shouldn't have,
    will just refuse to listen. "I didn't MEAN to offend anyone
    therefore, I didn't' seems to be their motto.

        One needs to be intelligent about language use, particularly in
        potentially sensitive situations. I recall watching a talk show
        where a African American man raised his hand to object to a
        point and the host promptly announced, using not only horrible
        language choice, but also incorrect usage "We have a reneger!"
        Oh God, I almost died right there in my seat. I think she meant
        "dissenter." You don't always have to used correct language, but
        you do owe it to others to not be fucking stupid.

            It should also be worth noting that language itself can be
            biased and sexist (and I've actually studied the psychology
            of word associations a bit, so I've seen the research.) We
            use "Black" as an adjective for bad quite often (black days,
            black mark on your record, etc. )and we do have 'black
            market' which implies illegal. These might seem like pretty
            minor things, but they exert a degree of influence over
            people whether they are aware of it or not.

    This reminds of when someone on the internet got onto me for using
    the word "jew". I never used to use that word.. it seemed offensive
    to me somehow, idk. But then a friend of mine who was jewish was
    always calling herself "a jew" so it rubbed off on me, and now I use
    "a jew" and "a jewish person" interchangeably. Anyway, do \*you\*
    find it offensive? Does it have offensive origins? I tried looking
    it up but couldn't find anything.

        Wut? I'm Jewish and identify myself as a Jew. I'm also really
        active in Jewish communities IRL and have never heard anyone
        express any issues with being called "a Jew."

        I think this is a good time to remind everyone that not
        everything that A Person On The Internet says in the name of
        Social Justice necessarily needs to be taken seriously, because
        people can have all kinds of individual issues and opinions that
        they may try to stick under a banner like that.

        My advice would be to talk to people who are affected by the
        issue at hand to see how they feel about it. Just like you just
        did with the word "Jew."

        I think you're completely fine.

        "Jew", due to the association of Jews with certain occupations
        in Medieval Europe (and well, the general Christian mythology
        about Jews) became a slur in the lips of Christians; it could be
        applied to someone you considered greedy, untrustworthy and so
        on, regardless of background (even the ethnonyms of other
        "Christian people" of a slightly different persuasion could be
        used in a similar manner but luckily most people don't know the
        origins of "bugger"). IIRC, "Hebrew" was preferred over "Jew" in
        writing for a period precisely because the latter had acquired
        those secondary meanings.

        You can see "Jew" being used as a slur today too, on the
        wonderful internet: "you greedy Jew!" (why, anti-semitism is
        still with us -- and I'm sorry if \*I\* sound offensive by
        exaggerating this usage, which is admittedly confined to slime
        pits; I've still seen it, unfortunately).

        So, I'm guessing that, due to all this, some people find
        "Jewish" less potentially offensive. Of course, it's better to
        ask the people the words refer to and not just follow the orders
        of random internet policemen/women, as suggested above -- no
        need to use workarounds if the people in question are ok with
        it; it's possible that you'll actually piss someone off more
        easily that way.

            Okay, everything you just said makes complete sense. I'd
            just never encountered anyone who opposed using the word

            Jewish.

    It's a lot like those poly people out there who don't experience
    jealousy. Like, ever (or at least, who haven't yet experienced it
    ever). Not all of them are obnoxious about it, but there are a few
    who are, who act as though it means they're better somehow. That
    holier-than-thou attitude is an easy way to spot people I'd never
    want to date, though, so I guess there's that. Anyone who thinks not
    experiencing jealousy is a factor of being a better all-around human
    being is going to be woefully unprepared for it if they ever do
    encounter something that makes them jealous (which doesn't always
    happen in such cases, but definitely happens enough that I tend to
    consider it worth being wary of), and I'm happy to not give such a
    person the chance to vomit that ineptitude all over me.

        Oh maaaaan I need to write about this sometime. I used to be an
        Extremely Jealous Person (back when I was monogamous), then I
        became Just A Little Bit Jealous (and became poly), and now with
        each passing day I have fewer and fewer feelings of jealousy.
        Good for me! But you know, I'm lucky. I've never been cheated on
        or abused by a partner, I've never been told by a partner that
        I'm worthless and they can find someone better. Obviously not
        everyone who has a lot of jealousy issues has gone through that,
        but many have, since jealousy tends to stem to a certain extent
        from feelings of inadequacy.

        I'm glad I'm so much less jealous now because it makes my life a
        lot easier, but I'm not going to delude myself into thinking
        that it makes me a "better" person somehow.

            I had to ask this on the whole poly deal. I'm not naturally
            a jealous person (I'm asexual and have been okay with people
            getting sex elsewhere), but I'm also monogamous, just since
            the relationship I'm in requires a pretty big investment,
            and I can't see handling 2 possible partners any more than I
            could handle a 3rd job at present. To me, it's less about
            jealousy and more 'how will these relationships work out
            logistically?' So to some extent I think it's a mistake when
            everybody assumes that it's jealousy that keeps people out
            of the polyamory world.

                Yeah, I definitely know plenty of non-jealous people
                (asexual and otherwise) who just aren't interested in
                polyamory for various reasons. Since I've basically
                *always* been interested in more than one person at a
                time, I've always had the motivation to be poly, but it
                wasn't always possible due to that intense jealousy. But
                obviously I'm just one case.

    You think you have problems now, just wait til you get old and

                You said above that language changes. And you know what?
                It does. Some people are willing to continue being
                respectful and considerate to other human beings, and
                some decide at the first sign of change isn't worth it
                because Obviously If People Don't Accept You Exactly As
                You Are Then They Suck. Guess what? Everybody has flaws.
                Everybody hurts people. We just asked nothing more than
                to fucking apologize like a decent person when you do
                so.

    Where is the line drawn? Who is the arbiter? And what happens when
    the apology isn't forthcoming?

    A whole lot of nothing, that's what happens.

        The line is drawn where I'm not going to spend time or form
        relationships with people who don't respect my boundaries and
        who feel no empathy when they accidentally hurt me. Just about
        everyone accidentally hurts someone at some point; when made
        aware of that fact, some feel bad and apologize sincerely;
        others dig in and blame the other person.

        Absolutely nothing happens when the apology isn't forthcoming,
        except that I cut that person out of my life. I've done it
        before and will continue doing so.

        This isn't really that difficult to understand. "Don't be an
        asshole" is a pretty basic rule that I do my best to live by,
        and prefer that the people I choose to associate with do the
        same.

    Thanks for the non-answer.

    Empty platitudes like "Don't be an asshole" or "Don't be a dick" are
    just meaningless insults that accomplish nothing, and are just as
    offensive as "Grow a thicker skin".

        You're welcome. I'm assuming you missed this part entirely:

        > Just about everyone accidentally hurts someone at some point;
        > when made aware of that fact, some feel bad and apologize
        > sincerely; others dig in and blame the other person.

        The "asshole" would be the latter person, in case that's not
        clear.

    Without an unbiased arbiter, it's not clear at all.

    Try to think of offensive words as tabloid magazines you ignore in
    the checkout line at the supermarket. Or imagine they're like
    religious threats of God's impending wrath.

    Oh, almost forgot: I apologize profusely if you find those
    suggetions offensive.

        There's no need to be so sarcastic; had you offended me I
        would've politely told you so. That said, I'm not really looking
        for advice on this matter, so you're probably wasting your time
        trying to give it to me.

        There's no such thing as an "unbiased arbiter"; every single
        human being has bias and refusing to acknowledge that by
        pretending to be unbiased doesn't serve anyone.

        It's pretty clear to me, personally, when someone's being an
        asshole about apologizing and when someone isn't.

        For instance:

        "Hey, it's really hurtful to me when you talk about 'raping' an
        exam or a video game because it reminds me of my own sexual
        assault. I know you don't mean it that way, but please try not
        to say that around me."\
        "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even realize I was doing that. I'll try
        to stop."

        Versus:

        "Hey, it's really hurtful to me when you talk about 'raping' an
        exam or a video game because it reminds me of my own sexual
        assault. I know you don't mean it that way, but please try not
        to say that around me."\
        "Dude, it's just a word. Get over it. Obviously I'm not
        *actually* saying it's good to rape someone. Calm down."

        The tabloid example seems to be a poor analogy. I can ignore
        tabloids, but the fact that other people do not and show more
        interest in tabloids than in legitimate news has a serious
        social impact in terms of a poorly informed electorate who are
        then unqualified to make decisions on public policy issues, or
        even determine what issues are relevant and require attention.

        I mean, I can ignore people who are racist, misogynistic,
        homophobic etc., but that's pretending they don't actually have
        an impact. Look into social psychology and yes, all this stuff
        does have a measurable effect.

    Yeah, I used to think my capacity to Not Be Offended by things was a
    marker of greater rationality, patience and levelheadedness.

    I'm still not offended by lots of things, but I no longer attribute
    that to the above list of qualities so much as I attribute it to my
    not having any particular trauma associated with \[whatever it is\].

        Yeah. I think one thing people don't realize all the time is
        that the same experience can actually be experienced very
        differently by different people. Some people experience sexual
        assault and just move on from it; others develop PTSD and suffer
        for years. Some people get bullied as children and mostly forget
        about it as soon as the bullying stops; others go through years
        of depression or self-hatred. Even if you went through a
        difficult experience and came out none the worse for wear, that
        doesn't mean everyone is able (or should be able) to do the same
        thing.

    I respect your idealism.

    I know this will sound callous, but someone claiming to be
    psychologically "hurt" just isn't good enough hard evidence to start
    censoring language wholesale. If this kind of "hurt" could be
    quantitatively/scientifically measured in some manner, I might be
    convinced to change my mind. Until then, in my opinion freedom of
    expression is too important to compromise, even in the ostensibly
    "innocuous" (and anecdotal) manner you are suggesting.

    Please don't misunderstand. I'm not saying people aren't
    hurt/traumatized by words. But if we are to be truly rational, we
    also have to account for people who are liars and manipulators.

        chaos\_engineer said it all for me. People keep confusing the
        idea that we should try to be kind and empathic with the idea
        that we should "censor" speech. No. I'm assuming you wouldn't,
        say, randomly tell someone that you think they're fat or that
        you hate their haircut, and yet nobody complains that this is
        "censorship."

    Who's called for anyone to censor language wholesale? All I'm seeing
    here is call for people to follow a basic rule of etiquette that's
    already been around for ages. I learned it as "You don't talk about
    the price of rope in a house where there's just been a hanging."

    > If this kind of "hurt" could be quantitatively/scientifically
    > measured in some manner, I might be convinced to change my mind.

    Pain is traditionally measured via self-reporting. Just to pick a
    random example -- when I go to a dentist and have local anesthesia,
    they'll always ask "Can you feel this?" before they start drilling.
    If I'm not completely numb then they'll wait a bit longer or give me
    an extra dose of novocaine. This kind of self-reporting isn't
    perfect, but it's better than any of the alternatives I can think
    of.

    > Until then, in/ my opinion freedom of expression is too important
    > to compromise, even in the ostensibly "innocuous" (and anecdotal)
    > manner you are suggesting.

    Well, yes, there are situations where freedom of expression needs to
    trump good manners.

    But if you're looking for validation from me, I'd need a clearer
    understanding of what kind of rude behavior you want to engage in
    and what positive goal you're trying to accomplish with it.

    > Please don't misunderstand. I'm not saying people aren't
    > hurt/traumatized by words. But if we are to be truly rational, we
    > also have to account for people who are liars and manipulators.

    I'm not sure I follow you. I mean, OK, someone comes up to me and
    complains about the price of rope, and I lie and say that my
    grandmother hung herself last week and that I don't want to talk
    about it. If he's truly rational (and polite), then he'll apologize,
    and then either change the subject or leave and find somebody else
    to discuss rope with. I understand that I'm being a liar and a
    manipulator if I do that, but I don't understand why I'd want to do
    it to begin with. Is this the sort of thing that happens to you
    often? All I can say is, in the long run, liars like that usually
    get exposed and disgraced.

    What was that with the 'liars and manipulators' comment (from 18).
    You mean members of marginalized groups who only pretend to have
    been hurt by insensitive remarks? This reminds me of the old idea
    that you get in some old literature that women just cry or act hurt
    to manipulate men, or the whole phrase 'cried like a serving girl'
    from Henry James -- the whole idea that a lower-class woman can only
    be an insincere manipulator and that any feelings from her should be
    discounted totally as pure performance, probably just to get out of
    work she ought to be doing for her upper-class exploiter.

    Well then we're not seeing the same picture. The devil is in the
    details, after all. Generalized platitudes regarding etiquette are
    not helpful, and the vast majority of people already agree with them
    anyway.

    > *Well, yes, there are situations where freedom of expression needs

    This comment doesn't even begin to explain why freedom of expression
    is of paramount importance in our society. In fact it seems to
    trivialize it.

    It's not trivial to me!

    We're just primates grunting sound waves from our pie-holes. Not
    bullets --- sound waves. (Or keystrokes on a keyboard.) I truly
    believe people can train themselves to parse the good and ignore the
    bad. But it takes practice, and the practice is painful. The
    internet hasn't been around that long, at least in the larger
    perspective, and surely skins are already getting thicker by the
    month.

        Seriously though, I'm not sure why you're wasting time telling
        people not to care about other people's feelings when you could
        just, erm, train yourself to parse the good and ignore the bad.
        Evangelical apathy doesn't really help anyone, and it's just
        increasing worldsuck. You still haven't said anything about what
        communicative benefit you are gaining from ignoring norms of
        polite communication; if there is ANY benefit other than not
        having to take two seconds to phrase something less offensively,
        it might help in convincing us that you are not just being
        selfish and rude.

    Well, it's a bit like people who say "what doesn't kill you makes
    you stronger". They forget that:\
    A) There's the alternative of being killed\
    B) No, being stronger isn't the most logical consequence.\
    Being broken is much more likely.\
    Nobody would say that if you survive your broken leg you'll run

    Ms. Daisy cutter, I'm happy for you that it doesn't bother you to
    have ableist slurs thrown around, but it does hurt me. Loaded
    language does mold people's attitudes toward people who already have
    enough to deal with without the casual ableism of others being
    constant background noise in their lives.

    The best analogy I can come up with (in the twenty seconds of

    And my reply was that I needed better evidence than "psychological
    hurt". Watching too much *Twilight* also has an "impact" on people,
    but I don't hear any calls for changing the (inane) dialogue on that
    TV show.

        Really?! Feminists and others talk about the problematic aspects
        of Twilight *all the time.* I've even written about it on this
        blog within the last few weeks. People are always writing and
        talking about what the Twilight films teach about love and
        relationships and how that can be harmful. My school's sexual
        education group is even considering developing a presentation on
        this exact subject.

        Also, there is evidence; you're just ignoring it. Did you read

    I'm sorry, must have missed your riveting blog about Twilight, for
    some strange reason.

    Okay that's a bit snarky.

    But since you're bringing up anecdotes, please allow me to inform
    you that I, as a human being, feel the pain you're referring to.
    Yes, I have my triggers. Yes, I've been discriminated against, and
    thrown out of good, high-paying jobs for just being me, even as my
    work is being praised. I HATE when people offend me with their
    words.

    Do I think any of my pain is worth abridging free expression?

    No.

    My position remains: work on your own head, and I'll work on mine.
    Leave free expression free.

        Again, nobody's free expression is being abridged. You are free
        to be nasty to people as long as you accept that this may cause
        them to dislike you and/or to stop associating with you. They
        are free to do that, just as I'm free to provide advice to
        people on how to prevent people from disliking you and refusing
        to associate with you, and just as you're free not to read my
        blog if you don't like the advice I'm providing on it.

        I see you haven't addressed my point about stereotype threat.
        You should consider addressing it.

        I'm confused, do you want people to avoid using that language
        around you or not?

        Because if you hate it in capital letters, that sounds like you
        want them to avoid it. But you also appear to think wanting them
        to avoid it is "abridging \[their\] free expression."

            There's a difference between what someone wants and what
            someone is willing to require of others. I would absolutely
            love it if every single person who crossed my path were
            wearing steampunk garb, but I'm not going to try and require
            that of them.

            Likewise, I HATE it when people engage me in small talk
            (usually), but what do I do? Politely respond and engage
            them in return. There's nothing wrong with wishing people
            acted differently than they do.

    Telling an ape not to grunt something is advocating the censorship
    of certain ape grunts. I find that idea to be highly questionable,
    and the research to be highly questionable.

    What was your point about stereotype threat? Give me the executive
    summary. I'm three seconds away from exiting this merry-go-round...

        I linked to a wiki article about it that gives a good summary,
        so I see no reason to rephrase it. You can click on the link;
        it's at the end of my blog post.

        Do you vocalize every thought you have about another person,
        including what you think of their appearance, outfit, job, and
        so on? If not, guess what--you're already "censoring" yourself.
        This is a basic aspect of functioning in polite society.

        I'm a full-time student and I don't have time to summarize a
        summary for you. I'm not asking you to read a 100-page
        dissertation. Argument from Authority would be saying that
        because I study psychology, you should agree with me. On the
        contrary, I've literally pointed you to the research; your
        refusal to read it says more about you than about me.

        If you continue in this vein, I'll probably ban you, because
        you're no longer making coherent arguments or saying anything of
        value. You're not going to succeed in getting a rise out of me,
        so you might as well stop trying and either read the suggested
        research or leave. This has become more boring than my grad
        school applications, and that's really saying something.

    Wow nohellbelows, you totally missed my point. You seem to be
    arguing that there are these Big Issues, and little things like say,
    discouraging misogynistic or racist language or rape jokes is this
    silly thing because it distracts from Big Picture issues like say,
    racism and sexism. I mean, rape jokes aren't the problem, actual
    rape is, and no way that a bunch of guys who spend their time making
    rape jokes has \*anything to do\* with actual rapes taking place.

    Also, you totally missed the whole tabloid point. If people read
    tabloids instead of real news, this is a problem. If young people
    are looking to Twilight to figure out how relationships are supposed
    to work, that's a problem.

    Given that I've spent years studying these issues in social
    psychology, I can chalk you up to basically deliberate ignorance,
    and probably some privileged indifference. The empirical evidence
    you demand actually exists. Go look into the field.

    Also, free expression means you can say what you want, but it also
    means that others are free to criticize it.

    On the 'petty insults,' petty insults (like using racial slurs,
    etc.) are part of the conditioning people engage in in order to be
    more callous towards outgroup members. In any military engagement
    since WWII, with the success of the word "Jap" the military always
    designates a term for the enemy. I recall reading a Korean war
    biography "The Four Deuces" where, among other things, the writer
    commented that calling the Koreans "gooks" made them much easier to
    kill.

    As you've said you've been discriminated against, do you think if
    people sat around, mocking members of your demographic all day, that
    this could impact how they treat you when they run into you?

    LOL Don't worry, I'll *self-ban*. But before I go:

    Even if I did read the article, don't you think it would be worth
    discussing? And once we started discussing it, don't you think your
    interpretation of its conclusions are salient to our discussion?

    I'm merely asking you to go first, in other words. If your
    explanation sounded intriguing and convincing, then I'd be much more
    inclined to spend time on it. No offense, but your reluctance is a
    bit odd. Did YOU read it?

    I'm sorry you find interaction with your commenters boring.
    Unfortunately in this particular case, I think the subject matter of
    your post is what is truly boring.

    Oh... and I apologize if you find that offensive.

        By this point, yes. I expected you to read the article when I
        first suggested it. Since you never gave a good reason for your
        refusal to read it, I wasn't about to capitulate to your silly
        demands. What sort of precedent would that set, hm?

    I'm not sure what point nohellbelowus is making with all the
    ape-grunt deal. I'm not for restricting them (whatever they are),
    just exposing them as (quite likely) insensitive idiocy which
    expresses nothing significant, and that perhaps the simians
    ape-grunting in the circle might be making themselves less capable
    of any sort social consciousness or necessary empathy. If a behavior
    might lead to harmful behavior, I will critique it.

            If nohellbelowus would just ditch the phrase 'ape grunt' and
            perhaps use examples of specific types of behavior and
            language they think people are over-reacting to then their
            points might actually make sense.

    On the flip side of "Don't be offended" is "Why aren't you
    offended?" (Or otherwise implying that I -should- be offended by
    something that, *to me*, isn't worth the time or energy to get upset
    over.)

    I'm disabled.

    And I am baffled by the way some able-bodied people trip all over
    themselves to be "PC" and "un-offensive" and "sensitive", using
    euphemistic terms like "special needs", and describing us as "people
    with disabilities" like somehow, you know, our disabilities and
    struggles *didn't* shape us and *aren't* therefore just as much a
    part of our identity as being black or christian or atheist or gay.
    I am *disabled.* I am not "handi-capable" (okay, I appreciate the
    word-play in that one), "differently abled" (dafuq is that supposed
    to mean?), nor do I have "special needs" (waaay to "precious
    snowflake" for my tastes), I am not fragile, and your vague
    euphemisms aren't helpful because every disabled person, each and
    every individual diagnosis is unique.

    And I've had able-bodied people respond to that by taking offense at
    my offense, pretty well boiling down to an attitude of "you're
    disabled, you're not supposed to *have opinions*, just let the
    able-bodied 'allies' take care of everything..."

    Anyway, this ties together because, um, I don't wanna be told what I
    "ought to" be offended by, and I'm gonna give others the same
    respect by not telling them what they should (or shouldn't) find
    offensive, because it isn't my place to dictate what you like or
    dislike.

    I think people choose to be offended and they can, if they wish,
    choose not to be. I couldn't give a stuff about people being
    offended. I really do think that an awful lot of the time "I'm
    offended by that" is used to try and validate a whinge about
    something someone doesn't like or doesn't agree with.\
    Having said that, I think that where "I'm offended" actually has
    meaning is when people mean "I'm hurt by that" and/or "I'm angry."
    And those are things I do have time for. I don't give a shit if I
    offend people -- but I would not want to knowingly hurt someone and
    I don't often want to anger people.\
    Several of the comments here are giving examples of "offensive"
    behaviour but the commenters haven't talked about saying they were
    offended; they've said they were hurt. Hurt, to me, is more
    meaningful and deserving of respect and apology and corrective
    action than "offence." I think "offence" is too often hijacked by
    people who are just annoyed that their world-view and their
    privilege is being challenged.

        Yeah, I think this is kind of what I was trying to get at in the
        post where I said that it's not a very precise word. "Offended"
        is also what people get when someone makes fun of religion, and
        it's what people call it when someone calls them a racial slur.
        But these things are not equivalent to me.

            Yeah. It's a hard one to debate without risking people
            thinking you're heartless if you say you're not bothered
            about "offended." I think the word is too generic, and it
            would be useful if people were more specific about their
            feelings -- hurt, angry, disappointed, or just outraged that
            someone criticised something they like.

    Apologising when you hurt someone is common curtesy.

    I tend to group offensive words into three categories.

    1\) Words that society generally agrees are offensive. Slang words
    for certain body parts or ethnic groups would fall under this
    category.

    2\) Words in common use that are offensive to certain groups or in
    certain usages. To uses two examples from above, some people are
    justifiably hurt by the word crazy, others in similar circumstance
    are not. Most people are not offended by the word Jew when it is
    just a description. I didn't know that a Joe was a jew is different
    than that guy tried to jew me down on the price.

    3\) Common words that are painful for one person for very personal
    reasons. This is the only instance where it may be ok to say, you've
    got to get over it. I.e. a person who gets angry or burst into tears
    whenever they see a hammer or hear the word and they work in a
    hardware store. They have a choice of doing something to get over
    the pain of seeing a hammer or getting a new job.

    The problem is that some people try to put examples from category
    one and two into the extremely rare category three. It's tough to
    remember avoid saying happy birthday around the one person you ever
    met whose offended by the term. It's not difficult to avoid using a
    word that a significant number of people around you would be
    offended by.

    Great article, although I have a problem with the notion that people
    can't change what they're offended by. (Not siding with people who
    are making rape jokes or anything.) Obviously it is tough to change
    emotions, but one of the things i've learned in life is how to
    deconstruct a lot of emotions like useless anger, especially since
    emotions are often informed by culture or evolution or the brain
    being a confused shit rather than an accurate depiction of one's
    relationship to the world. A lot of the times, these reactions can
    be broken down.

    Now, obviously that doesn't really apply to someone getting offended
    at being called a "faggot" and such, but it does apply to things
    like people being offended at homosexuality being put in a positive
    light. People being offended can be a really bullshit response which
    needs to be shifted. Another example: Nationalists being offended at
    their country's faults being depicted accurately. There are times
    when being offended is a poor emotional reaction which should be
    deconstructed.

    Sorry if my comment is horrendously bullshit in some way which I
    don't realize. Thank you for your articles, especially "Why You
    Shouldn't Tell That Random Girl On The Street That She's Hot".

    are prejudiced against them). It is sometimes difficult for them to
