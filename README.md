# Akinarticle

An adaptation of the 20 questions game to create an Akinator for [bafe.fr](https://bafe.fr) articles.
20 questions game adapted from [Andy Freeland and Dan Levy's student project](https://github.com/rouge8/20questions).

## Run
To run the program, enter 'python run.py' into the terminal.

You can specify an optional port number, but by default it'll run on port 8080, so open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser to access it. 

Admin pages can be reached at http://localhost:8080/admin

While playing, you can even use 'y', 'n', and 'u', to answer questions instead of clicking!
